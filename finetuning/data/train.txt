      EKG, radiologic studies, plain films, and as a result, I will        
      discharge patient. Test interpretation: by ED physician or           
      midlevel provider: plain radiologic studies, ECG. Counseling: I      
      had a detailed discussion with the patient and/or guardian           
      regarding: the historical points, exam findings, and any

      radiology results, the need for outpatient follow up, with the       
      PCP. a psychiatrist, the need to transfer to another facility,       
      came from Bayridge. Data interpreted: Cardiac monitor: rhythm is     
      normal sinus rhythm, with no ectopy, Interpretation: normal          
      rate, normal rhythm. ECG:.                                           
23:40 ED course: CXR, ECG w/out acute findings. VS (other than chronic chh 
      ST which is actually better than previously). Based on recent        
      and extensive work-up and nature of her pain, feel her pain is       
      not cardiac ischemia or due to PE, aortic dissection or severe       
      myocarditis or pericarditis. CXR shows no pneumothorax. No           
      hypoxia. Toprol XL Rx given for 2 weeks. I spoke with physician

Name:Christina Boga

DOB/Age: 2/6/1980/41 y.o.

Gender: female

PCP: Adora Maharaj, MD

Reason for hospitalization: "I was involved with some bad people. I think I'm being manipulated".

Limits of confidentiality: The patient was given the Lamb warning and acknowledged understanding that what

s/he does or says may be in the medical record and admissible in court if there are safety concerns around

antifreeze in 2018 requiring ICU admission, PMH of hypothyroidism,history of nontoxic goiter, B12 deficiency,

obesity, hypertension who presents for psychiatric admission because of worsening anxiety, increased

flashbacks of traumatic memories, and believes that she is being manipulated/monitored.     Urine tox positive for

Per note by Rose Danner, CNP:February was very difficult, anniversary of past wedding, brother has medical

issues, mother is very depressed. Pt is feeling very depressed, calling out from work. Says dealing with her

mother is getting to be too much. Says she is used to be the one who is being kicked--is being emotionally

abused by family.

Met with patient face-to-face in her room.  She is sleeping on approach.  Wakes to voice.   Oriented to full date.

When asked why she is in the hospital patient states "I am not sure.  I do not know if it is my mind or if I am

paranoid or if there is something going wrong." Describes increased anxiety, feeling that she is being

manipulated by family members who have harmed her in the past. Denies Suicidal ideation, denies urges to

self injure.

Increased anxiety started in February, attributes this partially to "the state of the world". Feelings intensified

over the past 6 days after keys to the apartment were "stollen from the door" when they were left in the door.

"went into panic mode, taped the door".     Since the keys were stolen describes increase in traumatic

flashbacks, states "I feel I am being manipulated".    When asked why she believes this patient responds

"people enjoy playing games and lying".     Is concerned that people from her past are causing this to happen.

She denies V/T/AH, "it's just a feeling that I have".  States "they're not good people and i'm starting to see it

now more than before because the man I'm with is showing me what love is really like".      Acknowledges that

she does not have any evidence that these individuals are interfering and acknowledges that her current

worries "could all be in my head".  When asked about mood states "stable to an extent".     Anxiety improved

since she arrived on the unit "right now I'm ok, when came into ER "beyond a 10".         Sleep has been decreased,

got "a little sleep" last night. Is napping today. Panic and anxiety keeping her awake.

With regard to medications for the most part consistent, missed 1 or 2 doses a week. Not intentional. When

taking them consistently reports they were working "so so", feels drowsy or wanting to sleep. Wellbutrin helpful

for mood. Denies feeling anxious with this medication. Has not tried increased dose.

Has been consistent with levothyroxine, intermittent adherence to vitamin supplementation.         Diet is poor and

appetite has been decreased since anxiety worsened about a week ago. Also reports low energy. Of note B12

low 192 on admission labs, known history of B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism TSH 9.05, FT4 0.9. BP

hypertensive.

--- HOSPITAL COURSE

--------------------------------

This patient was admitted to the adult psychiatry unit (Epstein 5) at North Shore Medical Center, where the

patient was treated by an interdisciplinary treatment team. The patient was admitted on a Conditional Voluntary

status.

Initial symptoms prompting admission were depressed mood, acute anxiety regarding past male partners that

presented as paranoia in context of stress related to pandemic and caring for her mother in the community, as

described above.

On admission to the unit, patient was initially isolative and slept. She did not present with overt disorganization.

No symptoms concerning for mania or psychosis. Paranoia seemed mostly function of acute anxiety and

related to post traumatic stress symptoms. During admission patient engaged with groups and was treated by

a multidisciplinary treatment team including case management and OT. She appeared to benefit from the

support and socialization of the milieu. She appropriately accessed staff support and engaged with therapeutic

groups on the unit.

#MDD and PTSD-patient had been out of psychiatric care and off psychiatric medications for several months

prior to admission.  He had been inconsistently taking fluoxetine in the community.    Patient was continued on

fluoxetine 40 mg daily.           Wellbutrin was not restarted due to concern that this would exacerbate

anxiety/reexperiencing symptoms.     Patient was started on quetiapine 25 mg nightly at bedtime to facilitate

sleep and target nighttime anxiety.  Patient rapidly improved with consistent sleep and after metabolizing

substances.  She had been utilizing cannabis in the community to help manage anxiety however this seems to

have had the opposite effect and increased anxiety/paranoia regarding past male partners.                 Patient also

presented with low vitamin D and altered TSH which may have been contributing to both anxiety and concern

for paranoia at presentation.     Patient was counseled at length during admission that consistency with Synthroid

and vitamin supplementation will be key to helping her maintain balanced mood and thoughts.               She

consistently denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation throughout hospitalization.  She demonstrated no

impulsive, disorganized, aggressive, or self-injurious behaviors.

Internal medicine was consulted for management of chronic conditions:

#Vitamin D deficiency - Vitamin D level 12 on 3/26/2021. Started on appropriate therapy with ergocalciferol

50,000 units weekly. Continue this for 8 weeks then may transition to cholecalciferol 1000 units daily.

#Vitamin B12 deficiency- Vitamin B12 level low at 192 on 3/26/2021. B12 increased to 1000 mcg daily. Would

repeat B12 level in 1 month.      If level is not in normal range consider changing to parenteral formulation.

#Hypothyroidism- TSH elevated at 9.05 but free T4 is normal at 0.9. Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg daily.

Recommend repeating TSH with reflex in 1 month; she is followed by outpatient endocrinology.

#Elevated blood pressures - Blood pressures have been intermittently elevated but also some in normal range.

Patient is asymptomatic throughout hospitalization and is not on any blood pressure medications at home but

does state that she has a strong family history of hypertension. Continued on cardiac diet during

3/25/2021

#Nicotine use disorder - Nicotine replacement therapy with NicoDerm patch. Encourage smoking cessation.

Patient declined nicotine replacement therapy at discharge.

On day of discharge patient was appropriate, thought process logical.       She denied suicidal ideation, homicidal

ideation, denied paranoia.  Patient volunteers that she plans on working on a healthier meal plan with her

partner at discharge.  Expressed feeling hopeful about partial program and the support I will provide.      We

reviewed some basic actions she can take to maintain her mental status in the community including refraining

from cannabis use, having consistency with her medications, and continuing with consistent therapy.         Patient

was receptive to this conversation and verbalized agreement.       She plans on continuing medications at

discharge and will check in with her outpatient prescriber about longer-term use of Seroquel.      Discussed that

ideally this would be a short-term medication which could be discontinued once symptoms stabilized further.

More than 30 minutes were spent in writing this discharge summary.

Safety Assessment:

Christina Boga no longer requires a secure, structured, inpatient, psychiatric setting in order to prevent

harm and to assure safety. The patient can be safely released to home/self care. Protective factors include

health seeking, denies suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, mood/sleep/appetite stable on current

medication regimen, patient with plan for follow-up at PHP, supportive romantic partner, stable housing,

stable employment, awareness of crisis resources, spontaneously future oriented towards returning to the

community. Risk factors include history of severe trauma, complex psychiatric history including prior

suicide attempt requiring ICU admission, intermittent adherence to psychiatric treatment, history of

cannabis abuse. Prognosis for recovery from current episode is fair with continued adherence to treatment

and limited cannabis use. Therefore, we feel the risk of imminent harm to self or others at time of discharge

ADMISSION PRESENTATION  
                        
CC: bizarre behavior
*
HPI: HPI obtained from patient and from medical record, as patient is a poor historian. 21 yo man with prior diagnosis of psychosis NOS who presented to BWH ED after friend's mother called 911 due to bizarre comments. See in ED by Psychiatry consultation to aid in evaluation of psychotic behavior/symptoms and need for further psychiatric care. Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited guardedness, paranoia and mild thought blocking. He cited vague AH (unclear if command in nature given guardedness), VH and SI. This presentation was similar to previous presentation at BWH which required inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Given severity of presentation/psychosis, the patient met Section 12 criteria and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization was recommended for its safety, stabilization, psychopharmacologic evaluation and aftercare planning. Patient was also evaluated for cough and fever, with CXR c/w PNA
************************
ED Events: Patient received azithromycin 500mg x1, risperdol and haldol. He was medically cleared and awaiting placement when he complained about not being able to uriate. A bladder scan revealed 1L, a straight cath was placed and 1L urine was obtained. After adequate PO, he was again unable to urinate and a foley catheter was placed, which prompty drained 500cc. He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation.
Patient unable to provide me with history of past urinary problems, nor is he able to relate the medical/psychiatric events of the last 24 hours. He is without any complaints currently, other than some mild discomfort from the foley catherter.
************************

************************
PAST PSYCHIATRIC HX: 
Presented here in 11/2012 with psychosis NOS. At that time, his mother had reported that he was experiencing 6 months of agitation, throwing things around the house and getting easily agitated. Reports that he was hospitalized at Arbour at that time. Says they put him on Ativan, and maybe other medications, at that time, but he does not remember the details, and he does not think he has been using any meds recently. Denies SA's. Pt reports having a psychiatrist, Dr Vaila (?spelling). Also reports having a therapist on Whittier St. Does not remember name or info, but at his presentation in 11/2012 he was seeing Dain William (617-427-1000), SW, for therapy .

 Differential diagnosis pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE: A single frontal and 2 lateral radiographs of the
 chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON: None available.
 
 FINDINGS: There are no dense consolidations, pleural effusions,
 or pneumothoraces. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable. No osseous abnormality is seen. Patchy opacity at
 the left lung base is nonspecific but in the setting of cough and
 elevated white blood cell count is suspicious for pneumonia.

HOSPITALIZATION SUMMARY  
                         
Surgical (OR) Procedures:
None

Brief Summary/Assessment:
21yo homeless man, recently admitted in 2012 for psychosis NOS, who is now BIBA from a friend's house apparently d/t bizarre comments. Presentation notable for low grade T with cough, leukocytosis and CXR revealing PNA and urinary retention in the setting of antipsychotics. 

Hospital Course:
# Urinary retention: No evidence of infection by lab data or history (although patient poor historian.) Concern for iatrogenic cause, unsure if patient has received either haloperidol or risperidol in past, however both can cause urinary retention. Foley removed on HD#1 and pt successfully passed trial of void. 
# CAP: Low grade T in ED to 100.3 with cough and leukocytosis of 11.8. CXR notable for LLL opacity. Treating with Azithromycin. Qtc 404. 
# Psychosis NOS: Evaluated by Psychiatry in ED with pt meeting Section 12 criteria. He was kept on constant observation. A BEST search is in progress. Pt was given Ativan for anxiety given urinary retention in setting of Haldol vs Risperdal. 
# DVT PPx: Lovenox

Patient presents with

?assaulted now with Headache/left eye trauma

Observation course: 39yM with h/o PSA presented following domestic assault with L orbital trauma and is

found to have subconjunctival hemorrhage and orbital floor fracture. He was evaluated by social work, plastic

surgery and ophthalmology.

Per optho note exam c/w consistent with resolving macular commotio, recs f/u with 1 week.

Per plastics: no surgical intervention, f/u within 1 week and sinus precautions.

Social work: Unfortunately,   no DV shelters available, he was provided with list of additional homeless shelters

and with passageways and DV resources.

Test results:

CT Head

Final Result

1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.

2.  Minimally displaced fracture of the left orbital floor.

Soft tissue structure interposed between fracture

fragments

likely represents the infraorbital nerve. No definite CT

evidence

of extraocular muscle entrapment.

=================================

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM

=================================

# AMA discharge.  Please see significant event notes dated 4/23 for full details of patients behavior.        Briefly, he

was physically and verbally abusive towards Psychiatry ("He then accidentally knocks his Playstation off the

counter and shouts, "Get outta here before I smack you".  When I respond that I have some other questions,

he grabs the chair in the room and whips it across the floor at me, yelling again "Get out, get outta here before I

fucking smack you"), then again to multiple providers during a multidisciplinary meeting to assist with his

discharge planning "He again escalated during this meeting, throwing a container of granola across the room,

using profanities, and referring to his history of self harm-- stating "am I going to be forced to do something

again" though without any overt SI endorsed during this meeting,"       which culminated in behavior later that

evening consisting of shouting profanities at staff, throwing his tray and items in the room, and smoking in the

bathroom which he had been told explicitly earlier this admission was against hospital rules.    He was told that if

his behavior (shouting profanities, being verbally abusive and physically threatening towards staff) continued,

he would be escorted from the hospital by security, but if he corrected his behavior he would be able to

continue to receive treatment.     As he had earlier in the day and at various points throughout this admission, he

did make threats to harm himself "I'm going to do something crazy" "If I wanted to hurt myself I would bash my

head against the wall."  His PICC was removed given his violent and unstable behavior with an initial plan to

continue through peripheral IV as he wanted to stay to finish his antibiotic treatment; he was able to verbalize

the consequences of not finishing his treatment.  However, he continued to be verbally abusive (threatening

bodily harm against staff and security, threatening to rape an RN's children) and after the removal of his PICC

demanded his belongings be brought to him so he could leave.       His belongings were brought to him and while

security was escorting him out, he attempted to assault one of the security staff.   The police were called and he

was arrested.

# MSSA Bacteremia, on nafcillin and treated WITH NO MRSA INFECTION - Initially febrile 3/14 during

previous admission, BCx grew MSSA in 4/4 bottles, remained positive (4/4) on 3/15, cleared 3/15. ID c/s during

previous admission and suspicion for cutatneous source of infx given e/o thrombophlebitis in L antecubital

fossa. MRI brain WNL. Initially w/ concerning TTE (3/15), TEE not obtained 2/2 pt deferral, TTE on 3/20 w no

c/f vegetation which made endocarditis highly unlikely and TEE was determined not necessary as it would not

change his course of abx which were: vanco (3/16-3/19), cefazolin (3/16-3/19) and transitioned to nafcillin with

plan for 6 wk IV course with end date 4/26. BCx NG x7 days, finalized 4/11.         ID was consulted; it was

determined that he would not need PO suppression at discharge, but did recommend follow up blood cultures

two weeks after his course was completed.   He was transitioned to cefazolin 2g q8h on 4/20 after he

developed a morbiliform rash on nafcillin.  Weekly safety labs were within normal limits, apart from a mild

elevation in eosinophils on 4/20.

- Follow up blood cultures with PCP; unable to set this up due to patient's AMA discharge.

# morbilliform rash & thrombocytopenia, - Rash emerged 4/20 overnight of unclear etiology given duration of

therapy on naf. Labs showed no eosinophilia or LFT abn. Transitioned to cefazolin out of an abundance of

caution though would be unlikely to develop nafcillin reaction so late into hospital course. Platelets were slowly

decreasing since 4/4, likely too slow to invoke HIT as an explanation (and seems to pre-date hospitalization);

possibly another component of suspected drug toxicity w/ nafcillin. He  Improved after abx switch to cefazolin.

# PSUD (inc etoh w/ w/d szs) - Prev complex withdrawal, none during current admission (had been drinking

<24 hr) after administrative dispo from Shattuck. Utox neeg at admission, EtOH 258.         Ativan was quickly

discontinued on admission given only one day of EtOH exposure and no signs or symptoms of withdrawal.                He

was continued on suboxone TID with good control of his withdrawal symptoms, as well as nicotine inhaler,

thiamine, folate, and MVI.

Discharge Summaries by Susan E Stanley, MD, PhD at 4/23/2018                      7:51 PM (continued)

# BPD/anxiety/depression - He had significant issues with splitting and non-compliance with care during

previous admission. Psychiatry, ACT, and ACT SW were all consulted during this admission. His home

lexapro, seroquel, and clonidine were continued in consultation with psychiatry.  Gabapentin was tapered and

wellbutrin were d/c given heavy EtOH use at risk for w/d seizures and overall limited improvement on both

medications. He was stable on this regimen for much of his hospitalization, but as discharge approached he

became fixated on his medications again, and increasingly abusive as above.       ACT SW worked tirelessly to

assist with discharge planning for this patient, but he was verbally abusive and refused to engage when he was

told that he would not be able to go to the dual diagnosis program he wanted.     As described above, he was

discharged AMA after his behavior escalated.

Plan:

- Outpt PCP can refer to BU system for ongoing psychiatric care as planned during previous admission

==================================

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL

==================================

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient has a complicated medical history tinged w/ polysubstance use disorder for which he recently had

a prolonged MGH admission, subsequently found to have high grade MSSA bacteremia. During that

admission, he had an initial TTE which was concerning for possible aortic valve mass (small irregular focal

thickening of the tip of the non coronary cup- 3/15). He deferred TEE x 2 after which, with ID consultation, a

repeat TTE was performed which showed no valvular abn. Given that the pt was determined to need a long

course of IV abx regardless, no formal dx of endocarditis was made and the pt was placed on a 6wk course of

nafcillin to end 4/26.

This hospital course was further complicated by worsening L shoulder pain for which an MRI was performed

which showed AVN of the humeral head- of note, the pt has b/l hip AVN which was thought to be most likely

iso EtOH use but possibly could suggest a genetic predisposition. He was discharged w/ plan for outpt ortho f/u

at BMC (4/24). He also had a R radial head fx w/ superficial laceration for which he also planned to f/u w/ ortho

in the outpt setting.

Finally, the patient has long history of difficulties w/ mgmt of chronic pain which, in the past, has lead to issues

w/ SUD. He was seen by chronic pain during admission and the recommendations were as follows: tylenol,

lidoderm, ibuprofen, gabapentin, consideration of robaxin TID and he was maintained on suboxone TID. His

past substance use history includes occasional crack cocaine use, crystal meth, oxycodone abuse, and IVDU

w/ heroin as well significant EtOH hx (seizures, no DTs, no ICU stays).

The patient was thus discharged to Shaddack to complete his IV abx while being maintained on suboxone.

Subsequently, the patient was administratively discharged on 4/4 around 130pm after the patient was found to

have passed a box of cigarettes reportedly w/ heroin inside. The patient states that he was unaware of the

heroin and instead was attempting to give a friend cigarettes from her boyfriend. He is struggling with the

stigma of both addiction as well as homelessness, both of which have left him feeling hopeless and alone

recently. He denies active SI and has not recently engaged in self-harm which has been an ongoing issue for

him in the past. Additionally, the patient reports that he was re-instated on oxycodone while at Shaddack but

per review of their records as well as ED provider confirmation, the patient remained on suboxone though he

frequently refused his doses there.

After his administrative discharge, the patient endorses significant EtOH consumption (level 247 at admission).

He attempted to purchase illicits on the streets and was unable to do so. He vehemently denies use of any

Discharge Summaries by Susan E Stanley, MD, PhD at 4/23/2018                       7:51 PM (continued)

Initial Vitals: 36.5 ?C (97.7 ?F)   HR (!) 119   BP 124/61   RR 20    SpO2 98 % on room air.   Weight 97.1 kg (214

lb 1.1 oz)

The patient initially presented to the MGH ED agitated, combative, and intoxicated. He was given 5/2 and put

in four point restraints, sectioned for disorganization. Bolused 1L LR for tachycardia. Potassium repleted,

tylenol, ibuprofen administered. Transferred to ED Boarder services. Cr, notably, had been mildly elevated at

time of previous discharge but was back at baseline on admission labs.

He was seen by ACT as well as psychiatry who noted that he was at very low risk of EtOH w/d given that he

had relapsed for only a few hours. Recommended continuing suboxone 8mg/2mg SL TID. Act SW to follow pt.

Psychiatry plans to re-eval pt in the AM given acute intoxication at time of presentation, recommended

resuming home medications.

On arrival to the floor, the patient is stable, afebrile, normotensive w/ normal HR and mentating well. Was

found to be smoking in room x 1 after which more aggressive nicotine replacement therapy was initiated. No

s/s of w/d.

Of note, the patient perseverated on oxycodone administration at time of admission, but after ongoing

discussions understood need for suboxone for long term control. Subsequently very invested in receiving prior

medication, wellbutrin, which he is adamant he was receiving at Shaddack. However, on review of these

records, it does not appear he was re-initiated on this therapeutic. Otherwise stable without significant

intervention throughout the night.

Review of Systems: Pertinent positive and negative as per HPI, otherwise a 13 point review of systems was

negative.

murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds x4.  Extremities:  There is no calf tenderness nor is
there any edema.  Skin is dry.

With this patient having no bony tenderness, having a low-speed mechanism
and being restrained, I do not believe he needs any imaging at this time. I
have discharged him home with a work note, I am giving him Motrin 800 mg
p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n., dispensed 20.  He has no history of peptic ulcer
disease as noted above.  I am also giving him Vicodin 1-2 tablets p.o.
q.4-6 h. p.r.n., dispensed 20; and Flexeril 10 mg 1 tablet p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n., dispensed 10.  He knows not to drive or drink alcohol while taking
the Vicodin or the Flexeril.  I am giving him a work note for 3 days off
work.  He is aware that he will probably be more sore tomorrow.

CONSULT REQUESTED BY: ED Attending
 
REASON FOR CONSULT: depression/drug use 
 
CC/PRESENTING PROBLEM: "I've been feeling miserable" 
 
HPI: 
23 year old female with a h/o polysubstance abuse, anxiety and depression NOS 
with 1 prior Bourne wood hospital admission 3 weeks ago for a drug overdose and 
potential parasuicidal behavior in that context. Patient was brought in by her 
boyfriend for a psychiatric evaluation. Patient reports that since her mis-
carriage 6 months ago she has found that she relapsed on drugs. Specifically she
has relapsed on cocaine, benzodiazepines and opiates (IV heroine). Patient is 
evasive at times in the interview and of note, per collateral information from 
her boyfriend James who accompanied the patient, patient self presented seeking 
inpatient psychiatric care but after learning that she could not smoke in the 
emergency room had become more interested in potentially leave the ED. 
 
Patient reports that she has felt "miserable" over the last 5-6 months and 
reports intermittent depressed mood, anxiety (worrying about her grandparents 
who are elderly, worrying about her own life and her drug addiction as examples)
. Patient reports that she has had preserved sleep and appetite though 
throughout much of the interview patient appears guarded and at times appears to
be minimizing her symptoms. While the patient denied suicidal ideation and 
denied that her recent Bourne wood admission following an overdose was a suicide
attempt, James the patient's boyfriend reports that following her Bourne wood 
discharge, the patient made a comment to him regarding "why didn't (you) let me 
just die". She has made other similarly themed morbid comments including wishing
she were not alive as per James but he has not heard her comment in any regard 
over a specific plan to hurt herself. James did report however that he feels 
"how many overdoses can she take" and expressed significant concern over the 
patient s safety. The patient reports that she would reach out for assistance if
she developed an active plan to hurt herself. She reports currently that she is 
motivated to live to preserve her relationship with her boyfriend. 
 
On psychiatric review of symptoms, patient reports that she had had prior panic 
attacks (2-3 lifetime) and also reports prior sexual/physical abuse (none 
currently) with intermittent nightmares, flashbacks and avoidant behavior. 
 
She reports fatigue as her main physical complaint. 
 
Patient discharged from Bourne wood on Celexa but she has been non-compliant 
with this medication since discharge. 
 
Patient once informed that we would explore inpatient options, became increasing
irritable, reports that she is a "junky and a drug addict but isn't fucking 
crazy." She subsequently comments "I just want to be able to smoke a cigarette.
" Patient subsequently became increasingly tearful as well. 
 
When writer inquired about Jame's cell phone, patient reports that it recently 
broke.

admission which was then followed by psychiatric hospitalizations. She presents for admission to the partial

hospital program in step-down LOC from 7E where she was inpatient from 10/1/18- 10/9/18, being discharged

after 3 day note came to pass.  She was inpatient after being escorted to the ED by her outpatient therapist

pharmacist reported in the past that the patient would request early refills.

working closely with Katie Rand NP, who is also her outpatient provider, to manage medications, which

medication. Throughout her admission, pt was perseverative on medications, specifically klonopin. On

evaluation today, she reports that she is feeling "much better" with decrease in depression, increase in

hopefulness. She continues to have moments of anxiety but finds that it has been more manageable even with

the reduction in klonopin. Affect brighter, future focused. Expresses commitment to following through with

Kerri Beaulieu is a 38 y.o. female who was referred to the PHP as a step-down from 7 East where she was

admitted due to suicidal statements to her therapist and misuse of Klonopin prescription. Upon intake, Kerri

reported "I have got a lot of stress going on in my life. I tend not to take my Klonopin as directed. I have been

stressed out to the max and I think I may have had a nervous breakdown." Kerri endorsed many stressors at

home including being the mother of 5 kids ages 20, 18, 17, 16 and 9 months. Kerri stated that she is struggling

with verbal and emotional abuse from her kids, and one of her teenage sons being out of control; problems

with her landlord and worrying about being evicted; chronic pain and multiple medical problems; misusing

Klonopin which resulted in Kerri not properly taking care of baby and DCF taking son into custody.

Kerri presented to Salem ED after police were sent to apartment for a wellness check. According to psychiatry

admission note, Police found patient unresponsive on the couch with her 9 months old baby faced down

between patient and the couch. Patient was unable to answer basic questions, patient's daughter was

concerned about

Baby's father died suddenly last year in a major car accident on Route 95. Kerri has been experiencing

agoraphobia for the past year and reports barely leaving her home this summer. Kerri suffers from PTSD due

to childhood trauma and rape as an adult. She reports having flashbacks and nightmares.

History of Prior Psychiatric Treatment (past hospitalizations, suicide attempts):

Per medical records, pt has a long standing history of anxiety and mood issues including panic attacks and

agoraphobia as well as PTSD from violence within the home and sexual assault. Pt also has a history of three

separate suicide attempts by an overdose requiring ICU admission which was then followed by psychiatric

hospitalizations. Pt reported to this writer only one prior suicide attempt via overdose on medication in 2015. Pt

once reported that she was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder. Records also indicate that there

has been concerns of Klonopin misuse as her pharmacist reported in the past that the patient would request

early refills. Pt reported to this writer two psychiatric admissions at Salem Hospital (2010 and 2015) with step

down to PHP, however no records were found that documented this.

Course of Treatment:

Kerri endorsed making progress while in PHP reporting that the PHP provided her with the structure and

support she needed to help her get through a very emotional time of dealing with losing custody of her son,

and working through medication changes. Kerri reported that she had been dealing with symptoms of

agoraphobia for 9 months and struggled to leave her household, Kerri endorsed finding her commitment to

being at the PHP helpful in combating her urges for isolation and avoidance and showed up to PHP with

minimal absences.Kerri was able to begin to work with her thoughts through CBT and DBT skills which

included mindfulness strategies, reality testing against distorted thought patterns and reframing skills which

she reports has helped her to manage other behaviors she was struggling with upon arrival.  Kerri endorsed

feeling  prepared to discharge.

Discharge Summary by Stephanie J Ferraro, CNP at 10/23/2018 12:33 PM (continued)

Kerri participated in a total of 7.5 sessions at the program.  During treatment, Kerri participated in both

individual and group treatment to develop new skills to manage anxiety and to regulate emotion

intensity. Skills that may be helpful with regard to symptom management for Kerri include: mindfulness skills,

CBT skills (working with thoughts), seeking social support, talking to friends, and therapist.

Kerri may benefit from continued outpatient psychotherapy services to address the following issues:            Anxiety,

depression, abuse of medication and isolating and avoidant behaviors. Specifically, Kerri may benefit from both

cognitive-behavioral and dialectical behavioral interventions to promote her ability to identify and re-frame

thoughts which may negatively impact her mood and help her to manage her emotions. Kerri would also

benefit from incorporating communication skills, self-soothing skills and coping strategies to manage social and

emotional stressors.

Kerri denied SI, HI, NSSIB or intent and appears future oriented.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS
ID: 25yo MWM (currently separated), w/ h/o depression and
polysubstance abuse/ dependence currently discharge from Ellison 7
(MGH) where he had been hospitalized after SA (jumping from Tobin
Bridge).

CC: ?I consider myself very fortunate? the Lord has saved me for a
reason?.

HPI: This 25 yo male has experienced several stressors in the recent
past and, in his own words, he has ?always been depressed? and across
the years he has used cocaine and oxycontin as primary drugs of abuse.
 Nevertheless, he has managed to seek help/ comfort in his own faith
as a Born Again Christian.
The pt has been separated from his wife in the past 2 yrs and is
currently in the process of divorcing. In Jan 2006, he was ?kicked
out? from the Marines, after a period of jail (4 months) for having
left w/o permission; he explained that he had done it in order to
meet w/ his girlfriend. In July 2006, he had a MVA with apparently
only minor repercussion, but most important in Oct 2006 he and his
mother were laid off from a ?used car parts shop?. Since then the pt
describes having been more focused on searching for a new job and not
attending church, as well as not working up as usual. The pt has
experienced depressed mood, as well as decreased interest in the
aforementioned activities, he was also feeling guilty ?for not going
to church as often? and ?for having let down himself and his family?,
he was nevertheless able to prepare his applications for new jobs,
his energy was ?always good?, there were no significant changes in
his appetite, sleep or psychomotor functioning. No SI or HI was ever
present according to the pt. In the weeks prior the SA the pt had
also restarted using cocaine ($50 / week). On the day of the SA
(12/11) the pt felt depressed and used cocaine, at that point b/c he
was ?high but guilty? he went ?without thinking? with his car on the
Tobin Bridge ?he pulled off and jumped?, in his own words he knew
that if he had ?stopped to think he would have not done it, and that?
s why he just went on?. The pt did ask for help afterwards.
At MGH the pt has been treated surgically for spleen laceration,
which had bled profusely in the abdomen, and conservative treatment
was adopted for right kidney and liver lacerations as well as for
lung contusions. Since the pt had hematuria, a cystogram was
performed, which ruled out ongoing bleedings from the bladder.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
MVA July 2006
Hypothermia
Injuries: C2 fracture, bilateral small PTX, bilateral aspiration,
displaced transverse process fractures on right at L1-L3, minimally
displaced spinous process fractures at L3-L5, grade 2/3 liver
laceration, grade 3/4 splenic laceration, small laceration to
superior pole right kidney


PAST SURGICAL HX:
12/11/06-Exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy
12/13/06-Angiogram, selective right renal arteriogram, celiac
arteriogram, R intercostal arteriogram

Medication/treatment history: Zoloft and Prozac (only taken for about
1 Ms ? the pt is not able to express if the meds helped him at all)
Out patient treaters: names and tel #: no PCP on files

The pt describes having being high at times although it is unclear
whether these episodes were ever unrelated to the drug use.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE:
Detox/rehab hx: Hospitalized approximately in 2003 in Salem MA for
detox from oxycontin and cocaine and subsequently in psychiatric
floor for depression.
IVDU: denied heroin use.
No cig.; 1-2 beers twice weekly; ?Never had a drinking problem?.

The pt described starting using drugs for recreational use when 17yo
(ecstasy and ketamine ?party drugs?). He described also being
depressed from 17-18yo and having been mildly depressed since then.
He also described having developed a real substance dependence on
OxyContin (max 80 mg/ day) and cocaine (max 1-2 gm/ day) which led to
the detox in 2003 at Salem MA. In the past 1 yr the pt has been ?
clean? and the AA meetings as well as the church activities helped
him to maintain sobriety.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT
Please see discharge summary dated 12/09/06 for full details
regarding pt's physical injuries and hospital course while on the
surgical service.

On admission to Blake 11 pt was willing to take medications but
minimized suicide attempt, stating that he just wanted to move
forward and forget about the past. He signed a three-day notice on
the day he was admitted, which he retracted 2 days later. He stated
that he was happy to be alive and looking forward to the future.
After gathering collateral information from the patient's family, it
seems the pt had been suffering from symptoms of depression for
several weeks in the context of financial difficulties. He had
decreased sleep, poor appetite, and low energy. His mother stated
that he had made passive suicidal statements to her, and that this
attempt may not have been completely spontaneous. He did not endorse
psychotic symptomsat any time, and though he tended to be hyperverbal,
 he did not exibit other signs or symptoms of mania. He did have some
notable distractibility, and the treatment team felt that he should
undergo evaluation for ADHD at a later date. Seroquel was initiated
for treatment of anxiety and titrated up to a final dose of 25qam and
100qhs. He responded to this medication well with no complaints of
side effects. Wellbutrin SR was initiated for treatment of depression
and possible ADHD. Wellbutrin SR was titrated up to a final dose of
150mg BID, which he tolerated well. Pt was also followed by
psychologist, Dr. Caleb Siefert, for therapy during his
hospitalization, focusing on substance abuse and suicide attempt.
Neuropsych testing showed a 98/100 on the 100 pt mini mental, hthough
he appeared to have some problems with attention and sustained
concentration (from Trails A B). PAI revealed elevations in
antisocial/impulsive behaviors as well as substance abuse/dependence;
he also evidenced some signs of mania and depression.
Pt remained in good behavioral control throughout his hospitalization.
 He remained focused on discharge, and presented as superficially
happy and unconcerned, though had some moments of insight,
particularly when working with Dr. Siefert. He re-submitted a 3-day
notice on 12/25/06. The treatment team worked to set up a dual
diagnosis PHP at Salem hospital as well as an outpatient psychiatrist.
 However, the patient's 3 day expired before discharge planning was
complete. Pt was encouraged to rescind 3-day notice so that adequate
aftercare plans could be made. He refused, stating that he would not
agree to attend the PHP and would rely on friends, religion, and
AA/NA. The team expressed concern that this was insufficient given
the pt's previous failures and current stressors, but the patient
would not sign in and refused aftercare. Despite the team's concerns,
he posed no acute safety risk, as he had denied SI/HI throughout his
stay, and had repeatedly expressed that he was happy to be alive and
hopeful about the future. Pt was able to make a safety plan and
agreed to continue taking medications as prescribed. Therefore, the
team discharged the patient against medical advice.

Dental consultation was ordered for evaluation of dental pain and
sensitivity. They found no evidence of acute intraoral infection, but
did find reversible trauma-induced pulpitis of #19 and 20 which may
be causing the hypersensitivity. There was no indication for
treatment at this time, but they recommended follow up with
outpatient dentist for routine care.

Pain Mgmt: Pt was weaned from Oxycodone and MS contin were weaned
throughout his hospitalization. He tolerated the taper well, with no
signs/symptoms of withdrawal. At the time of discharge, he had been
taking only MS Contin 15mg QD with good pain control. Therefore, he
was discharged with a prescription for MS Contin 5mg PRN x 5 pills.

Medically, the pt remained stable throughout admission. Routine CBC
revealed platelets elevated to 1600s. Hematology was consulted and
stated that the platelet elevation was as expected post-splenectomy
and that he was at low risk of clumping or embolization. They stated
that he did not need to be on ASA or any anti-platelet medication at
this time, though they recommended that his plt level continue to be
followed as an outpatient.

Dispo- Pt agreed to follow up with outpatient PCP, Dr. Feygina on
1/4/06. She will prescribe his psychiatric meds for one month until
Mass Health kicks in, and then will refer him to an outpatient
psychiatrist. Pt refused dual diagnosis PHP. Pt states he will attend
AA/NA meetings and become more involved in his church for support.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
ECT weekly wasnt enough.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS
Per admission note:

Sources of Information:  Patient (fair historian) and medical record

Identifying Data and Chief Complaint:  ECT weekly wasnt enough.

Ms. Leonard is a 34 yo single woman with GERD, hypothyroidism, and
migraines, and past psychiatric history of schizoaffective d/o with
multiple hospitalizations (most recent Blake 11 on 12/31-1/9), 2 or 3
suicide attempts and hx of SIB, who self-presents from home
accompanied by her mother for worsening depressed mood, CAH to kill
herself and SI with plan and intent in the context of tapering
ECT/one delayed session, delayed psychiatric follow-up, and
psychosocial stressors.

HPI:
The patient was discharged from Blake 11 on 1/9/15 after a nine day
admission following transfer from McLean Southeast Hospital for ECT
for treatment of CAH and depression. During that admission, she
received 4 ECT treatments, with plan to continue [weekly] outpatient
ECT. Her medication regimen was significantly simplified, with
trilafon and Latuda discontinued in favor of olanzapine 10mg QHS.
Wellbutrin was also discontinued and she was maintained on Lexapro 15
mg QAM. With these medications and ECT, her mood lifted significant.
Auditory hallucinations ceased completely and she no longer felt
suicidal. The patient reports that she continued to do well until she
missed an ECT session on 1/27 (delayed to 1/29 due to a snow storm),
at which point the CAH returned and were characterized at first by
worsening ego-dystonic self-deprecating statements as well as
multiple conversant voices speaking gibberish. She also notes return
of depressive symptoms around that time, including severely depressed
mood, hyperphagia (w/reported  10lb wgt gain), decreased energy, poor
concentration, psychomotor agitation, and feelings of hopelessness.
(Denies anhedonia, difficulties w/sleep and feelings of helplessness
and guilt.) The depressive symptoms and CAH progressively worsened
and yesterday she started experiencing intermittent CAH for the
patient to kill herself (by way of throwing a hair dryer into water,
swallowing pills, cutting herself, and strangling herself.) The
patient also developed active SI yesterday with plan and intent due
to depressed mood so bad she just wanted to die. She had non-specific
plans to strangle herself (a previous SA method for her). At this
point she states that she no longer felt safe at home and knew she
needed to come into the hospital. She additionally reports anxiety in
social situations and notes that this sometimes bring on the voices.
She reports requiring her PRN lorazepam over the last couple of days.

She reports recent stressors of: accidently reading a book about
suicide, feeling stuck at home because of the snow, confusion over
when she is supposed to see her psychiatrist (per discharge summary
appointment is for 2/17/15), and her brother privately divulging his
own psychiatric issues of not taking his medications and having a gun.
  She denies medication changes since discharge and reports good
adherence. She also reports seeing her therapist weekly since
discharge. She denies HI or CAH to harm others. She denies psychotic
symptoms of VH, IOR, paranoia, delusions, TW/TI/TB. Denies symptoms
of mania, recent PTSD symptoms and panic attacks. Per APS note: Dr.
Henry and Dr. Goetz both FYI paged about pt's admission. Collateral
from Dr. Henry: Agrees w/decision to admit to hospital. Would like
her to continue receiving ECT while inpt, as she has had a good

Assessment:
Ms. Leonard is a 34 yo single woman with GERD, hypothyroidism, and
migraines, and past psychiatric history of schizoaffective d/o with
multiple hospitalizations (most recent Blake 11 on 12/31-1/9), 2 or 3
suicide attempts and hx of SIB, who self-presents from home
accompanied by her mother for worsening depressed mood, CAH to kill
herself and SI with plan and intent in the context of tapering ECT,
delayed psychiatric follow-up, and psychosocial stressors. Her
current presentation is c/w schizoaffective disorder with a current
depressed state and SI w/plan and intent. Factors leading to
worsening symptoms appear to be tapering her ECT, medication
adjustments during hospitalization, delayed timing in seeing her
psychiatrist, as well as some psychosocial issues as listed in the
HPI. Given her dramatic improvement with ECT during her last
admission, she would most benefit from more frequent ECT and
titration of medications to improve maintenance of affect, as well as
follow-up with her psychiatrist closer to discharge.

Patient is at high risk of harm to self given active SI with plan and
intent with past SA using the same method, SIB, and CAH. Protective
factors include help seeking behavior/insight, medication compliance,
connection to treatment, stable housing, lack of substance abuse, and
supportive family.

She requires inpatient hospitalization for safety, containment,
diagnostic clarification, psychopharmacologic evaluation, group and
milieu therapy, and aftercare planning.  Target symptoms include the
patients mood, her AH, and her suicidal ideation. Goals for admission
include diagnostic evaluation, initiation of treatment,
coping/psychological skills.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT
HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. Leonard is a 34 y/o woman with a history of hypothyroidism and
schizoaffective disorder, with multiple prior psychiatric
hospitalizations (most recently on Blake 11 from 12/31/2014 to
1/9/2015) and 2-3 prior suicide attempts who was admitted to MGH on
2/11/2015 due to increasing depression, command AH to kill herself,
and SI in the setting of missing her ECT treatment.

The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit at MGH for
further evaluation and care for schizoaffective disorder.
The patient was admitted under conditional voluntary status.
The attending physician of record was Dr. Christopher Celano.

1) Psychiatric Issues:
Schizoaffective disorder: On initial presentation, the main target
symptoms were depressed mood, AH, and suicidal ideation.  Collateral
information was obtained from her outpatient treaters (psychiatrist
and therapist) and family.  For diagnostic clarification, B12 level
and folate were tested and were wnl. Vitamin D level was low (26).
FTA-Ab screen was negative. Presentation was consistent with
exacerbation of underlying schizoaffective disorder. For management
of psychosis, home zyprexa (10mg QHS) was titrated to 10mg BID. For
management of depression, home Lexapro (15mg QD) was titrated to 20mg
daily. Finally, ECT was transitioned from once weekly to three times
a week given her response to this treatment in the past.  Over the
course of her stay, the patient completed 6 treatments (last on
02/25/15) with plan to continue treatment next on Friday (2/27/2015)
as an outpatient. The patient tolerated the medication changes and
ECT treatments without side effects. She attended groups and
occupational therapy.  With these interventions, the patient's
symptoms improved significantly.  Though she initially had
breakthrough symptoms (depression and command AH) in between her ECT
treatments, later in her course she noted a significant improvement
in mood and a resolution of AH, even on days she did not receive ECT.
 On discharge the patient reported improvement in mood and had no
command auditory hallucinations. She was able to verbalize safety
plan including grounding techniques and calling family, if she has
worsening mood, psychosis, or thoughts of self-harm.  She was
encouraged to follow up with her outpatient providers and continue to
receive ECT after discharge.

2)  Vitamin D deficiency: Level low at 26. Initiated vitamin D with
1000mcg/day.

3) Migraine: We continued home Sumatriptan 100mg po Q2H PRN (max
200mg in 24 hrs) and topiramate 50mg QHS.

agreement.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT:
From a safety perspective, the patient is at chronically elevated
risk for self-harm.  Risk factors include her history of
schizoaffective disroder, her hsitory of prior suicide attmepts and
self-injurious behavior, her psychotic symptoms and SI prior to
admission, and her depressed mood prior to admission.  However,
several things mitigate this risk: since admission, the patient's
mood has improved significantly, and she now denies depression; she
has denied AH for the past several days and continues to deny
psychotic symptoms at this time; since admission, the patient's SI
and HI have resolved; she can identify protective factors (her family
members); she is spontaneously forward-thinking (she looks forward to
returning to her day program, doing artwork, and spending time at
home); she has been tolerating her medications and ECT and plans to
continue to receive them after dishcarge; she lives with her parents,
who are supportive; she has been engaged in treatment while here and
plans to remain i treatment after discharge; she has established
outpatient treaters and will follow up with them after discharge; she
attends a day program, which wil continue to provide her with
increased structure and support; she slef-presented for treatment,
thus demonstrating her ability to reach out for help when needed; and
she can engage in safety planning, including identifying triggers for
worsening symptoms, identifying people to contact if her symptoms
worsen, and recognizing the need to call 911 or go to the nearest ED
if she develops SI/HI.  She does not appear to be at imminent risk
for self-harm at this time.

Discharge Summary by Teresita G Balderas, MD at 10/14/2020                9:53 AM (continued)

Gender: female

PCP: Lynn Community Health Center

Reason for hospitalization: suicidal ideation with plan to OD on Lithium

Limits of confidentiality: The patient was given the Lamb warning and acknowledged understanding that what

s/he does or says may be in the medical record and admissible in court if there are safety concerns around

discharge.

History of Present Illness:

Patient is a 31 y.o. female with history of

Schizoaffective disorder Bipolar type, PTSD, GAD, Panic disorder, who presents for psychiatric admission

because of suicidal ideation with plan to overdose on Lithium.

During interview patient reports she was having suicidal thoughts after she had a panic attack during which she

felt "dizzy, unbalanced, with shortness of breath, confused, disoriented, lost", "I couldn't stop crying" and

started having thoughts of death and suicide, "my parents didn't know what to do with me" "they called the

ambulance". She says started seeing "rats coming out of the room", because she has seen rats in the kitchen

that the landlord doesn't call the pest control for. She started feeling overwhelmed and thought the room her

parents and her live in is "cursed". She cannot get out and take fresh air because there are men outside that

flirt with her, that makes her feel very uncomfortable, they invite her to spend the night with them, they made

suggestive gestures to her that bring intrusive memories of the rape she was victim of years ago.  She feels

like she is going to be raped again when they approach her. There is an old man that lives in the rooming

house where she lives that has touched her before without her consent and has been intrusive when she is in

the bathroom; this man touched her in the arm when she was waiting for the ambulance to come she had to tell

him "don't touch me!", it is very distressing for her to live in that place, she doesn't find peace there, she started

crying and couldn't stop crying. Patient says she has panic attacks for many different reasons, if she gets in the

shower, she doesn't feel safe, her mother cooks, but she is afraid of getting close to the stove because is afraid

her hair will get on fire, or the stove is going to "blow up". She has trouble organizing her room, her belongings,

if it is messy she gets overwhelmed and has panic attacks. Her mother has to help her cleaning, organizing

and even helping her take baths.   Patient is not happy living in the place she lives, her parents suggested she

go to live with her cousin. She has a sister but cannot live with her sister because the home is not hers, belong

to the brother-in-law. She comes back to the idea of her parents getting an "RV to go travel" instead of living in

that room. She denies HI, has AH of voices telling her "Hey", visions of rats coming out of the room, feels

threatened by men flirting with her, suffers reactivation of the PTSD from prior rape, has intrusive memories,

flashbacks, avoidance, hypervigilance, denies nighmares, says has a lot of dreams but doesn't remember

them. She has frequent panic attacks, and general anxiety triggered by mundane activities like putting order in

her room.

Patient gave verbal consent to contact her family members

DISCHARGE SUMMARY

NAME: DONOVAN, MATTHEW J               UNIT NUMBER: 416-39-13



ADMISSION DATE: 01/10/2005             DISCHARGE DATE: 01/24/2005








DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Axis I:     Bipolar I Disorder, most recent manic
            Cannabis abuse
Axis II:    Deferred
Axis III:   H/O childhood seizure disorder
            S/P MVA with head injury
            H/O dyslipidemia
Axis IV:    Educational stressors, social environment
Axis V:     25 on admission; 55 on discharge

CHIEF COMPLAINT: "There is nothing wrong with me, I am here for blood
work!

HPI: This is a 23 y/o SWM with bipolar disorder and a history of psychosis,
brought to the APS by his mother at the recommendation of his
psychopharmacologist, Dr Carol Wool, for worsening symptoms of mania. He
has had hypomanic symptoms since New Year's Eve, consisting of increased
energy, talkativeness, and impulsive driving that resulted in minor MVA's.
He was seen by Dr Wool 5 days ago who increased his Risperdal. His mother
reports that 3 nights ago, he used cannabis with his friends, and since
then his hypomanic symptoms progressed. Over the past several days, the pt
had shown very poor judgment such as getting lost and deciding to sleep in
his car overnight, punching walls, almost hitting his 20yo sister, and
threatening to leave the house at midnight without any money or gas in is
car. He has also been increasingly grandiose, has had decreased sleep (4
hours/night), decreased appetite, and described losing control when he
hears rock music that resulted in crashing his car into a snow bank. In the
APS, the patient exhibited poor insight into his manic presentation and
appeared preoccupied with starting community college on 1/24/05. He denied
any psychotic symptoms, SI, or HI, but did tell his mother that he felt
like stabbing people seen on the local news. In the APS, he received
Risperdal 2mg x 2 for restlessness, pressured speech, practicing martial
arts, and lifting the table to the secured waiting area. He was cooperative
with staff and with taking medications, and responded well to Risperdal.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
   1)    Childhood seizure d/o (grand mal at age 7, on depakote for 5
      years)
2)    Head trauma following major MVA when 20 yrs old

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: The patient had his first manic episode on an
airplane shortly after sustaining a head injury in a car accident that
resulted in the death of 3 passengers (pt was not driving). On the
airplane, the patient became very anxious and yelled out that he had a
bomb, which led to being arrested and being hospitalized for 7 months in a
federal institution. He has tried numerous medications and is currently
taking Risperdal and Depakote, but his compliance is an issue, especially
in conjunction with alcohol and cannabis abuse. He was most recently
hospitalized 12/04 at Baldpate for 6 days; he has also been at Lynn and
Salem hospitals for approximately 3 weeks each for mania. No known history
of SI, SA, or HI. He has recently revealed to his mother that he
occasionally hears voices, but denies CAH. He has seen Dr. Carol Wool twice
so far, most recently 5 days prior to his presentation at the APS. He is
currently in weekly therapy which he feels is going well.

Treaters: Psychopharmacology: Dr. Carol Wool, MGH; therapy: Rick Phillips.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
   1)    Risperdal 1mg PO QAM plus 2mg PO QHS

FAMILY HISTORY: Mother's first cousins: one with post-partum mental

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a single, unemployed male living with his

in Oregon after being expelled from Peabody High School seven months prior
to graduation. Has tried to take college courses in the past without
success due to mental illness, and now is planning to enroll in community
college courses this winter semester, with plans to become an engineer. He
reportedly recently revealed sexual abuse by a 10yo boy when he was 5yo.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY: Reports social drinking of 2 beers on the

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1) Bipolar disorder:  On initial presentation, the patient's behavior was
disorganized and irritable requiring frequent redirection and time outs in
his room, although never escalating to the point of requiring restraints.
He was angry at his mother for bringing him to the hospital and had little
insight in to his mental illness or current manic state.  Over the course
of the next several days, his behavior slowly de-escalated and he admitted
to needing better control of his mood symptoms.  The patient's Risperdal
was increased from 1 mg. q.a.m. plus 2 mg. q.h.s. to 1 mg. q.a.m. plus 5
mg. q.p.m.  He was also started on Neurontin which after several
adjustments was finalized at 1000 mg. PO q.h.s.  His Depakote was also
increased from 500 mg. b.i.d. to 500 mg. q.a.m. plus 750 mg. q.p.m.  On
this increased medication regimen the patient's behavior slowly normalized
although he continued to have difficult interactions with certain patients
on the unit.  He expressed a strong desire to go to school and became angry
when he was told that he may not be able to be discharged before his
orientation started on Monday, January 24th.  By that Monday however he had
exhibited better behavior control and according to his mother was back to
his baseline.  He was discharged on Monday January 24 for outpatient follow
up with his Psychiatrist, Dr. Wool.

In addition to his mood symptoms the patient also experienced periods of
sedation, which required medication adjustments.  On his discharge regimen
he appeared to have adequate control of his mood without debilitating
sedation.

2) Endocrinology:  The patient had a history of increased triglycerides on
Risperdal. When a fasting lipid panel was checked on January 23rd following
the increase in Risperdal, he was found to have markedly elevated
triglycerides at 417.  His resident Internal Medicine doctor, Dr. David
Pride, was alerted to this fact and he will follow the triglycerides on an
outpatient basis to determine if the patient will require either medical
treatment of his dyslipidemia or adjustment to his psychiatric medications.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
   1)    Depakote 500 mg PO QAM plus 750 mg PO QPM
2)    Neurontin 1000 mg PO QHS
3)    Risperdal 1 mg PO QAM plus 5 mg PO QPM

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION AND FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient was discharged home
to his mother's house with the following outpatient follow-up:

1) Dr. David Pride (Internal Medicine) at Massachusetts General Hospital
Wang Building on January 24, 2005 at 3:00 p.m., 617-726-2674.

2) Dr. Carol Wool (Psychiatry), at the Massachusetts General Hospital Wang
8th floor on February 17, 2005 at 9:30 a.m., 617-726-7935.

3) Bridging psychiatric appointment with Gail Leslie, RN located at the
Massachusetts General Hospital emergency room on February 3, 2005 at 11:00
a.m., 617-724-7687.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable and improved.

Ms. Antonini is a 31 year old single, day program worker with a self reported 
history of MDD, anxiety, opiate dependence, alcohol dependence in fsr and 
cocaine abuse who was brought in by sober home staff with reported worsening in 
mood and suicidality in the setting of recent relapse. Patientv reports that she
has been struggling with worsening depression since tyhe death of her brother 
from heroin OD 6 months ago. She had been attempting to handle well, but became 
increasingly anxious, struggling to express despair and feeling and began using 
IV heroin again. She states initially she would use once on weekends, but over 
the past 3-4 days has been using a gram/day. Approxinately one week ago, she 
began having intense urges to end her life with frequent thoughts of overdosing 
on heroin. However, states she even lacks the motivation to mobilize enough 
money to buty a lethal amount of heroi. She was kicked out of sober home today, 
after being discovered to have relapse as well as friends finding her locked in 
her room, missing for several hours. Patient states that during that time, she 
was in her room intermittently sleeping and contemplating suicide. She is 
seeking help with sobriety and desire to live.

HOSPITALIZATION SUMMARY
Hospital Course
#Depression: Ms. Antonini was admitted to 2 South after being brought in by her 
sober home staff for worsening depression and relapse on heroin in the setting 
of grieving the death of her brother that was due to accidental heroin OD. 
During the first few days of admission, Ms. Antonini was quite dysphoric, 
expressing continued SI and high anxiety, and mostly remained in her room, in 
bed. She informed team that she had abruptly stopped taking her hom Effexor days
prior to admission, and this was restarted, as some of her symptoms were thought
to be due to withdrawl from the medication. Eventually, her symptoms improved 
and she became more social. She was able to participate in groups and became 
social on the unit. She was able to engage in safety planning. She denied any 
continued SI and was optimistic about discharge and follow-up.
 
Psychopharmacology: Effexor 225mg restarted. Continued home trazodone 100mg QHS.
Both hydroxyzine and clonidine were tried for anxiety symptoms. Ultimately, 
found to be most effect was 50mg hydroxyzine taken at the same time as 0.1mg 
clonidine TID. This controlled symptoms of anxiety quite well. 
 
#Opiate Dependence: patient was monitored on CINA. She was given comfort meds 
including robaxin, bentyl, clonidine, immodium, and hydroxyzine. It was decided 
to start her on a suboxone taper for detox. This was started at 2mg QID and 
tapered. At the time of discharge, she was taking 2mg BID and was given 
prescripton to finish the taper as an outpatient (2mg BID X 4 days, then 2mg 
daily x4 days). There were no complications to the detox process.
 
#Migraine: home topamax 50mg daily continued
 
#Safety: monitored on 15 minute checks, restricted to the unit.
 
#Legal: CV signed and accepted on admission. 
 
She was in very good behavioral control and participated in groups on unit.

Hospital Course

In brief, this is a 26-year-old male with past psychiatric history of impulsivity and behavioral dysregulation who

was transferred from Brigham and Women's Hospital following a reported suicide attempt by overdose on his

Depakote pills (reportedly took 40 pills of 250 mg tablets) on 7/17/2015, reportedly triggered by his recent

breakup with his husband of 4-1/2 years as well as financial stressors.   Patient was observed on the inpatient

medical unit at Brigham for Depakote toxicity; however, his labs did not show significant abnormalities. The

overdose is questionable given that the patient's Depakote level and lab values remained stable. In fact, pt

later recanted this, stating he never actually overdosed. He endorsed that he did not take an ingestion of

depokote and that he had lied to the team. He would not disclose why he was being untruthful.Pt's tox screens

were negative. He was reportedly calm and cooperative during his stay on the medical unit at Brigham;

however, upon presentation to the inpatient psychiatric unit at Faulkner, he started becoming agitated which

escalated quickly to being aggressive towards the staff.         He was physically aggressive and hit multiple staff

members.    Accordingly, he was placed in physical restraints and was given chemical restraint as well.Following

this event, pt accepted po medication, haldol and ativan, and was in behavioral control. Pt signed a CV and a

3-day letter, requesting discharge. Pt stated he was not suicidal nor homicidal. Pt expressed no regret for his

behavior. States he simply "gets angry sometimes". States he "closed" his case with DMH and is not involved

with them. States he is not taking any medication, stating it makes him sedated. States he is staying at a DV

shelter, but refuses to disclose name or location.   States he feels safe there. States he has plans to get a job in

Cambridge and secure housing through an agency he is working with. States he is estranged from all his family

members. Denies PTSD sx or mood sx or psychotic sx. States if he were suicidal, he would go to the nearest

emergency room. Review of Partners records for past several months show numerous ED visits (BWH and

MGH) where pt was frequently seeking shelter, gave inconsistent history, and recants any expressed SI. It is

noted that pt had refused all services offered through DMH and his worker Ms. Clapp noted he was just

seeking shelter and did not require hospitalization. Note is made of h/o assaultiveness. Pt discussed at length

in team meeting. Pt felt not to be in a major mood episode, not acutely psychotic, not withdrawing, not actively

suicidal or homicidal and will not benefit from further hospitalization.  Further hospitalization would potentially

put staff at risk of harm. Pt is declining offers of aftercare.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
Depressed mood and irritability.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS
Mr. Carcamo is a 31 yo single hispanic man with a past psychiatric
history of MDD, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder with
multiple prior psychiatric hospitalizations (most recent MGH Blake 11
on 4/2004, multiple non-life threatening SA who was brought in on
Section 12 by police after his mother called regarding concern that
he would harm her in the setting of significant alcohol use and
multiple recent life stressors.

Patient refuses to provide any recent history to this interviewer as
he doesnt want to speak to any more doctors and states that he is
only here because his life is controlled by people [he] hates the
most... white people. He feels that he does not have a mental illness
and is simply just angry at life. He feels that we are just going to
label him anyway, and that it is his zyprexa that causes his mood
symptoms because when he stops it he becomes depressed, doesnt sleep,
has low energy, and cant concentrate. He reports good adherence
because of this, but reports having attempted to stop about a month
ago with development of these symptoms. He also reports having had
the zyprexa increased to 7.5mg from 5mg QD over the last week, but
does not want this restarted because he feels increased doses make
him angry and irritable. He blames his mother for ruining his life by
being a prostitute when he was a child and lying and telling everyone
that he was seeing and hearing things then making him start all of
the medications. He feels that zyprexa is the cause of his mood
symptoms. He feels that hospitalization will not help him because it
was not very helpful in the past and he states he will not
participate or talk to the doctors. He denies depressed mood and any
current neurovegetative symptoms of depression; reports good energy,
concentration, and sleep at present.

Per APS history the pt reported worsening depression and irritability
in the context of multiple stressors including having lost his job,
not having any income, being on Zyprexa, and gaining weight which led
him to cut his clothes. The patient reports that on day of
presentation, he was overwhelmed with anger and began to cut his
clothes when his mother entered the room and told him to stop. He
subsequently threatened that he would stab her in the abdomen with
the scissors and told her to get away which prompted her to call the
police. He reports significant alcohol use over the past month
consisting of 1 bottle of wine or hard liquor each night. He stated
that he wants to quit but also feels that the alcohol helps him with
his creativity and he uses it to numb himself. He denies any history
of withdrawal seizures or DTs, but reports some increased anxiety in
the context of stopping drinking a few days ago. No prior detoxes and
denies other illicits. He required a locked door seclusion due to
anger and agitation while in the ED, but did not require 4 point or 2
point leather restraints at that time. He was offered 5mg zyprexa
which he accepted at midnight of the 28th/29th, but refused 5mg later
when he became severely agitated.

He denies any history of manic symptoms and psychotic symptoms,
including AH/VH. He refuses to answer any questions regarding
trauma/PTSD symptoms and panic symptoms. He does report some anxiety.
Pt denies any history of violence. He denies current suicidality or
homicidality.

Collateral from APS is from his mother:States patient has had
significant depressed mood for past several months with significant
worsening over past several days. On day of presentation he began to
cut his clothes with scissors but denies he made threats of wanting
to harm her. She feels that he is not safe to be discharged at this
time given decline in mood but denies overt suicidal or homicidal
ideation. The mother strongly believes he should be hospitalized
given increased irritability and decline in mood. She stated that he
is not welcome back to her home at this time.

Collateral from Dr. Chamberlin per APS (PCP and prescriber of
Zyprexa): Has been treating him for 1 year. Cluster B personality
traits, bipolar, and suicidal thoughts are indication for zyprexa. He
sees him approximately every 3 weeks. At last appointment (12/9/14)
he had flat affect, chronic suicidality. He had increased his alcohol
usage and requested ambien, which was refused. He later prescribed
the ambien in order to minimize the alcohol usage (pt told him he was
using alcohol to help him sleep). He paged an on call doctor stating
that he was drinking on top of it. He does not know him to use other
substances. They have difficulty predicting when he will actually
attempt suicide given the chronic suicidality, there is no
appropriate behavioral contract. Over the last year that he has known
him, no actual suicide attempts. His only knowledge of SA is through
the psych history portion of notes he has received from the patient's
hospitalizations

Past Psychiatric History:
APS report of medication trials per collateral from PCP- pt has been
on multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants in the setting of
multiple hospitalizations, but PCP could not state medication names
or doses. Dr Chamberlin "strongly recommends" that he not be taken
off the Zyprexa, as he does not do well.
Per records, Diagnoses: MDD, PTSD, borderline personality disorder
Hospitalizations: approximately 8 prior psych hospitalizations
including Blake 11 (most recently 4/2014 and also in 2012), First
hospitalization at age 18 in NYC,
Suicide attempts: self-reported 6 times including cutting wrists,
overdose, going to the top of a building to jump, and tying rope
around his neck. Self-injurious behavior by cutting arms. His last
suicide attempt was 7 years ago when he tried to jump from a building
but was stopped by security, and the trigger was feeling that
medications were not helping.

Assessment:
Mr. Carcamo requires inpatient hospitalization for safety,
containment, diagnostic clarification, psychopharmacologic evaluation,
 group and milieu therapy, and aftercare planning.  Target symptoms
include the patients mood, paranoia, insomnia, and homocidal ideation.
  His current episode of agitation and violent threats leading to
hospitalization appears to have been triggered by excessive alcohol
intake and intoxication. Given the patients history he appears to
have an underlying mood disorder, as he has had episodes of depressed
mood even when not abusing substances, and it appears that with this
episode the patient was self treating an underlying depression and
insomnia with alcohol, all of which may have been set off by stopping
his zyprexa about a month ago with return of significant depressed
mood and neurovegetative symptoms. He currently demonstrates
psychotic symptoms of delusions and paranoia surrounding his
diagnosis and treatment, and particularly surrounding caucasian
individuals (which is interesting from a more dynamic perspective
given the patients use of light colored contacts and dying his hair).
The patient denies any history of manic symptoms or overt
hallucinations (but reports his mother had previously lied to people
and said he had seen things, but he is not a reliable historian, and
collateral will be important to r/o bipolar disorder, psychotic
disorders, or other underlying mood disorders, especially given the
peculiar medication choice of zyprexa for an MDD diagnosis. Further,
given the involvement of significant alcohol in this episode makes it
very difficult to assess what primary mood symptoms that patient has
or if irritability and psychotic symptoms are primary or 2/2
substance abuse. Additionally, it is important to note his PCP
reports cluster B/borderline personality symptoms that he has noticed
in his year-long clinical relationship, however, this cannot be
assessed during this brief interview.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT
Mr. Carcamo is a 31-year-old man with a history of cluster B
personality traits, mood disorder, and likely alcohol use disorder,
who was involuntarily admitted to MGH due to concern for worsening
depression and irritability, in the context of heavy alcohol use.
The patient was admitted to the locked, inpatient, psychiatric unit
on Blake 11 at MGH for further evaluation and treatment of mood
lability and alcohol abuse. The patient was admitted under
involuntary (Section 12) legal status. The attending physician of
record was Dr. Stuart Beck.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  The patient presented with the following
issues on admission.  A biopsychosocial approach was employed to
address these problems, which included medications, psychotherapy,
and social services.

1. Mood disorder: The patient was minimally engaged on the unit and
demanded discharge from the onset of admission. On diagnostic
evaluation, he was guarded with most questioning, but did report an
extensive trauma history (witnessing violence in his country) and
chronic feelings of oppression, which he attributed to his ethnicity.
He was illogical in explaining how these experiences may have
contributed to the current crisis. He denied suicidal and homicidal
ideation and remained in behavioral control while on the unit. He
denied psychotic symptoms and his thoughts were reality-based. He was
offered but declined multiple levels of mental health treatment,
including medication evaluation, individual and group therapy,
substance abuse treatment, and outpatient day program. He was

SAFETY ASSESSMENT
The patient no longer requires inpatient psychiatric care on a locked
unit. He does not meet criteria for involuntary commitment. No acute
safety risks have been identified. He has been counseled on the
potential benefits of mental health treatment to address mood
disorder, substance abuse, and trauma history. He has declined all
levels of care to address these issues. He has been counseled to
reach out for help from providers and family if symptoms worsen and
to go to an emergency room or call 911 if feeling unsafe. Therefore,
we feel the risk of imminent harm is low at this time and the patient
is therefore appropriate for outpatient care.

SAFETY PLAN
If the patient develops thoughts of self-harm or harming someone else,
 the patient was instructed to call 911 or go to the nearest
emergency room immediately. The patient expressed understanding and
agreement.

currently.  He is, however, quite tearful throughout the interview.  Mother reported that she was concerned that

he might harm himself if he returned home.  He has a history of significant depression leading to psychiatric

hospitalization.  He had been prescribed Zoloft 200 mg by his primary care physician but the as not followed up

Past psychiatric history: Patient had been bullied in school since eighth grade, resulting in transfer to another

school.    2 years ago he was hospitalized at UVM for 2 weeks.       He has no history of actual suicide attempts and

no history of psychosis.

Social history: Patient graduated a couple of years ago from Champlain University.       He got a BA in film but has

been unable to get working that field.  He has been working for 2 years at a restaurant but does not really like

this job.   He lives with his mother.  His brother is attending University of Pittsburgh and apparently having some

dormitory issues there.    A sister has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and has been treated at McLean.

Substance abuse: Patient uses LSD about every 4 months and also marijuana.           He denies use of alcohol or

other drugs.

Past medical history: Patient has been in good health.   Hypokalemia was noted in the emergency room.

Mental status:

Patient is alert and oriented.  He is tearful throughout the interview.  His main preoccupation is letting friends

hallucinations.   He denies current suicidal ideation although he said that he was feeling suicidal earlier.        There

is no homicidal ideation.  Judgment and insight are limited.

Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Screener/Recent Self-Report)

drugs denies this was SI attempt)

2. Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts (Past 1 Month): Yes

3. Active Suicidal Ideation with any Methods (Not Plan) Without Intent to Act (Past 1 Month): No

4. Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, Without Specific Plan (Past 1 Month): No

5. Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent (Past 1 Month): No

6. Suicidal Behavior (Lifetime): No

Impression:

Unspecified depression.

LSD and marijuana use.

Initial treatment plan: Patient will be admitted to 3 Usen on 15-minute checks.      Further treatment planning by

the attending physician.

Addendum:

I spoke at length with mother.     Mother highlighted the patient's history of being bullied, his artistic creativity in

film as well as editing and writing about film, and his frustration with working in a restaurant rather than being

able to work in his chosen field.    Patient had a good experience with the day program at McLean after

hospitalization at University of Vermont Medical Center, where he also had a good experience.     Mother would

like him to be transferred to McLean if possible, or at least to be able to be referred to the day program there.

He also seemed to have a good response to Zoloft although, with Covid restrictions, getting consistent

psychotherapy and following up with medication has been difficult.

Revision History

HOSPITAL COURSE: I met with the patient at the day of his admission. The patient's safety, ADLs, vital signs,

compliance with medications, groups attendence were discussed with staff and treatment team. Medical record

was reviewed. Potential side effect, risks and benefits of medications were discussed. The patient was in good

control, coherent and cooperative with the interview. He admitted to using LSD in conjunction with marijuana,

which altered his mental status: he was naked outside his house; police was called and he was brought by

ambulance to ER for evaluation. The pt reported that has been feeling depressed, and had "dark thoughts",

and ;used drugs to make himself to feel better. He stated that has been using LSD "every 3-4 months, and

marijuana 2-3 weeks". He reported feeling paranoid from LSD, "but never experienced anything like that" ( the

pt was referring to his confusion and bizarre behavior prior to admission). The pt stated that has minimal

recollection of the events, leading to his admission. He denied use of any other drugs.

.  He reported that has been struggling with depression since middle-high school, when he was bullied, and

needed to be transfer to another school. At that time he started to cut himself, and tried to hang himself, using

a sweat shirt, attached to a pine in the basement of the school. The pt added: " I knew that it will not work". For

a brief period of time he was treated with psychotherapy.

Two years ago, the pt was hospitalized at Vermont Medical Center for depression and SI. He was a at

Champlain University at that time, majoring in film. Since that time he has been treated with Zoloft 200 mg,

prescribed by PCP. During COVID, he took himself off Zoloft, and restarted recently at the same dose. The pt

denied neurovegetative symptoms, mania, psychosis, aggression, withdrawal symptoms.

He attended a PHP at McLean Hospital few years ago.

The pt denied any active medical problems. NKDA.

He graduated from Champlain University with BA in film, however, has not been able to find a job in the field,

and has been working at the restaurant for the last 2 years, which has been a major source of his

disappointment and frustration. On the other hand, the pt talked about a movie, which he has created, and "feel

passion about it". He is hopeful that some production companies will be interested in it too.

The pt lives with his mother. His parents are divorced. Father lives in Colorado, and he has minimal connection

with him. The pt has a sister, 25 y.o., who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. His younger brother (22 y.o.) is

a student at University of Pittsburgh, and will stay at home during summer. The pt is single, never was married,

no children.

He signed CV. The pt is willing to continue Zoloft, which was started at 50 mg. He gave permission to talk to

his mother and PCP.

Pt's mother called. She was upset about the pt being admitted to NWH, instead of McLean Hospital. Her

understanding was that the pt will be admitted directly to a residential program there. The admission process to

a residential program was clarified. Based on pt's progress, and improvement of mental status, he will be

transferred to 3 E. The mother was satisfied.

The patient has been denying any complaints, and has been reporting "pretty good mood". "good" sleep and

appetite. He denied SI/ Hi/ delusions/ hallucinations. He stated that his thinking is clear and organized. On the

other hand, he said, that "need to continue to work on mental health issues". The pt was vague about it, but

said that his goal is to be sober. He agreed that need to work on healthy coping skills. The pt stated that would

agree to go to a partial program, or a residential, program, but it should be McLean Hospital. He was willing to

have a family meeting with his mother towards the end of the week.

Vital signs have been stable and within normal limits.     Laboratory data were unremarkable.    Electrocardiogram

showed normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.        ADLs have been good.  The patient has been compliant with

medications and group therapy.

On 06/25/21, I met with the patient and his mother together with Sarah Podsen, LICSW. The pt's diagnosis,

clinical progress, current treatment, and preliminary aftercare plan were discussed. Apparently, the pt believed

that he is leaving today. When he realized that it is not the case, he became upset, and left the room. The

mother stated that the pt is "on spectrum", and has difficulty with processing information. We addressed

yesterdays incident, when staff discovered presumably LSD pills in pt's phone. The pt denied using any drugs

since admission, stating that "wanted to flush them down after discharge, just did not want to create more

drama". The pt and mother agreed that the pt will do Zoom PHP after discharge, and will be referred to SA

program, Naukeag, at McLean. The patient's safety, ADLs, vital signs, compliance with medications, group

attendance and clinical progress were discussed with staff and the treatment team.

On 06/28/ 21, Andrea Batista, LICSW spoke to the pt's mother. She wrote: "Reviewed in treatment team

rounds.

Received a call from patient's mother.   I reviewed the aftercare plans in place. Mother voiced agreement with

these plans. Mother stated that she is in favor of discharge to home today.

Appointments as per discharge form.

24 Hour Crisis number provided and reviewed."

The patient case has been discussed with the treatment team regularly.          We all agreed, that the patient is

stable and safe to leave the hospital, and continue his care in virtual partial program.      He has a follow-up

appointments with a therapist and psychiatrist.     Referral to  Naukeag is submitted.    At the day of discharge, the

patient stated that his mood is "good".     He is hopeful and future oriented.   He adamantly denied suicidal

thoughts, homicidal thoughts, delusions, hallucinations.       He also denied access to firearms.  The patient

presents no imminent likelihood of self-harm or others.      He is capable to make a treatment decision, and is not

committable.   His mother is supportive and agreed with discharge and aftercare plan.

Prescriptions for Zoloft 100 mg p.o. daily #14 and melatonin 3 mg p.o. nightly #14 were electronically submitted

to CVS in Wellesley.   It is recommended to titrate Zoloft up to 200 mg/day, which was preadmission dose.

I spent more than 30 minutes with patient discharge.

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 22-year-old single white male,
presented to the emergency room because he was feeling more depressed and said
that he was feeling suicidal. Apparently he was just discharged from Newton-
Wellesley Hospital on April 23. After discharge, he said that he continued to
feel depressed and actually he met some person who molested him when he was age
16, and patient said that it did bring up the memories. He was feeling that
this person was threatening him. He reported it to the police but apparently he
is saying that police actually arrested him, but when they arrested him they
brought him to the hospital because patient was feeling depressed and suicidal.
On top of feeling suicidal and depressed, he was drinking and his blood alcohol
level while he was in the emergency room was 235. His tox screen was negative
for other substances. Patient was admitted as a volunteer admission.
 
PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Patient had prior admissions to Newton-Wellesley
Hospital being the most recent admission in April, was discharged on April 23.
He has a history of substance abuse including marijuana and alcohol, and
currently he is using Percocet for his back pain and seems to be addicted to
it. His outpatient psychiatrist is David Kimball. Patient also has a history of
anxiety.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Severe scoliosis causing back pain. He was prescribed
Percocet by his primary care. He denies any other medical issues.
 
ALLERGIES: Reports allergies to PENICILLIN and ERYTHROMYCIN.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient currently is not working, he is unemployed, lives with
his parents in Waltham. His mother has breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy
and radiation. Patient has applied for SSDI and waiting on decision for that.
 
LABORATORY DATA: Unremarkable.
 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted as a volunteer admission. On mental
status exam he presented as alert and oriented x3, slightly disheveled,
somewhat anxious, speech was within normal limits. He did not present with any
psychotic symptoms, was able to contract for safety in the hospital, insight
and judgment were limited.
 
During his stay in the hospital, he was continued on current medications which
were Trileptal 600 mg twice a day, he was taking Percocet 2 pills twice a day,
maximum 4 pills a day, Benadryl at bedtime, and Valium 10 mg up to 3 times a
day for anxiety. On this regimen of medication patient said that he was feeling
better, was able to attend some groups, that he had learned some coping skills,
and was feeling ready for discharge.
 
Upon discharge he presented as alert and oriented x3, future oriented, clearly
denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations, no psychotic symptoms. He agrees
with discharge plan which includes that he will be seen by David Kimball, he
has an appointment on May 2, noontime, and will get an Edinborough Center with
Brian Rahterty, phone number (781) 894-8440. He was recommended strongly to
follow up with AA and NA.
 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: AXIS I: History of bipolar disorder, rule out substance-

tablets as needed every 8 hours, maximal 4 pills in 24 hours. Benadryl 50 mg at
bedtime. Valium 10 mg up to 3 times a day. We discussed with the patient that
given his substance abuse history, it would be recommended to taper off Valium
and that he should be tried on antianxiolytic medication.

Psychiatry Discharge Summary

Admit date:  9/28/2016

Discharge date:  10/4/2016

Patient Information

Melissa A Kjersgard, 29 y.o. female (DOB=  8/24/1987)

Code Status at Discharge:  Prior

Presentation at Hospitalization:

Patient is a 29 y.o. female with a history of multiple substance use disorders (heroin, cocaine, inhalant,

Klonopin), depression and anxiety, prior inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, self-presenting requesting detox

(Klonopin, huffing computer duster). APS consulted as collateral from sister indicated concern for suicidality.

The pt reports ongoing Klonopin use, purchased on the street, for which she has tried to self-taper to 0.5mg

daily though recently she has had periodic escalation, including reporting taking a "hand full" of Klonopin the

previous day. She also reports starting to huff computer duster starting in July. Shortly after that she left her job

at Wallgreens. She was at her PCP's office on 9/26 and while in the bathroom there used computer duster,

passed out and hit her head. She suffered a laceration of her scalp requiring staples. As her 4yo daughter was

with her the daughter was taken from her custody at that time.

The pt reports ongoing worsening depression since the father of her child left her in February. Her mood has

worsened further in recent weeks. She endorses poor sleep (2-3h/night), low energy, poor concentration,

reduced interest. Appetite is ok. She denies suicidal thoughts/intent/plan, and disputes making suicidal

statements (reported by her sister, see below). She lists her daughter as her reason to live. On psych ROS she

denies current or past history of manic or psychotic symptoms.

Per the pt's sister Nicole (857-247-8341): The pt has been very depressed recently and has repeatedly passed

out/been found unresponsive, including in a library, dunkin donuts. On 9/26 she fell and suffered a scalp

laceration requiring staples (Whidden ED). She was discharged the previous evening and spent the entire night

out. She also has been huffing 6-8 cans of computer duster/day. The pt also disclosed to her sister that she

took 20 Klonopin tabs (dose unknown) the previous day. When asked why, the pt reportedly said that she

hates her life and wanted to die. The pt recently lost her job, daughter is in DCF custody (father is filing for full

custody currently) after being found down while her daughter was around. Mother and sister are interested in

pursuing section 35.

Hospital Course

The patient was admitted to the locked inpatient, psychiatric unit on Blake 11 at MGH for further evaluation and

treatment of her benzodiazepine withdrawal and question of suicide attempt.  The patient was admitted under

conditional voluntary legal status.

The attending physician of record was Dr. Masoud Kamali.
Discharge Summaries by Masoud P Kamali, MD at 10/4/2016              7:02 AM (continued)

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:              The patient presented with the following issues on admission.

1.  Benzodiazepine withdrawal; the patient?s withdrawal was addressed with a chlordiazepoxide taper with q4

VS monitoring and CIWA protocol lorazepam dosing as needed for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Her

doses were primarily given to target abnormal VS with increased BP and HR, patient also had episodes of

diaphoresis, however never developed tremor, gait instability, frank psychosis or seizure activity. The patient's

mother was able to obtain a section 35 hearing for her daughter and the patient was going to present to Malden

court for a hearing on her day of discharge for consideration of necessity of mandated inpatient substance use

treatment.

2.  Suicide attempt: The patient adamantly denied attempted suicide with increased dose of clonazepam prior

to admission and consistently articulated reasons to live. Her symptoms of depression, including depressed

mood, low energy, poor concentration, reduced interest were addressed in a multimodal fashion. Medically,

she was started on fluoxetine 20mg daily as well as trazodone 50mg nightly for help with insomnia with good

effect. She was also briefly trialed on quetiapine without effect on her insomnia and so this medication was

discontinued after one dose. She was active in the unit milieu and participated in group therapeutic

interventions with occupational therapy. Social work was involved to coordinate the patient's aftercare plan and

coordinate with the patient's family.

3.  Medical issues.

#Pyelonephritis

The patient was c/o flank pain, worse with inspiration on hospital admission, UA was not a clean catch with

present squamous cells, 1+ WBC. She was started on a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg BID for

presumed pyelonephritis. Patient reported resolution of her flank pain after admission and tolerated doses of

the ciprofloxacin.

#Head laceration

The patient presented to MGH after sustaining a fall and head laceration which was stapled at Whidden

Hospital. The patient's wound did not reopen and she denied complaints of headache, swelling, and the site

remained intact without edema erythema or tenderness. Staples were removed uneventfully on Monday 10/4

per recommendations received from Whidden hospital.

#VS elevation

The patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal was primarily evidenced by vital sign abnormalities including low-

grade tachycardia (peak HR in 110s) and BP elevation. She was treated with a progressive chlordiazepoxide

taper with good effect.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT

The patient was at elevated risk for self-harm on admission due to active symptoms, substance use including

inhalants, clonazepam, and prior history of heroin and cocaine use, stressors including the loss of custody of

her child with DCF involvement. She adamantly denied suicidal intent with increased dose of clonazepam

taken prior to admission. However, since admission, the patient has has had improvement of symptoms, has

committed to sobriety, in agreement with family plan to pursue inpatient substance use treatment through

Section 35. The patient engaged in treatment (groups, individual work) on the unit, and has taken and tolerated

medications without problem.    Finally, over the course of the hospitalization, the patient became more hopeful,
Discharge Summaries by Masoud P Kamali, MD at 10/4/2016                    7:02 AM (continued)

more engaged, and more future-oriented, as evidenced by her commitment to sobriety, accepting the plan to

attend court-mandated inpatient substance use treatment even if it meant that she had to go through the prison

system in order to be reunited with her daughter.

The patient is at chronically elevated risk for harm to self or others compared with general population due to

her substance use however, pt is protected by supportive family.  Patient is motivated to continue outpatient

psychiatric treatment. Patient is able to articulate a plan to reach out for help from providers and family if

symptoms worsen and to go to an emergency room or call 911 if feeling unsafe. Therefore, the patient is not at

acutely elevated risk of harm at this time and is appropriate for outpatient level of care.

EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN:  Jenai E. Beland Cohen, M.D.

TIME SEEN:  0130

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right shoulder stiffness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 33-year-old man who says at 2:30 p.m. he was
riding his bike away from the liquor store when he was sideswiped by a
vehicle. He says he ended up under the car.  He does not think the car ran
over any specific part of his body, but he says his right shoulder and the
right side of his neck and the right upper back feel stiff.  He said he
noticed grease on his pant legs, but his legs feel fine.  He also has a
laceration on his left finger, but he has put a Band-Aid on it; it is not
bleeding, and he does not think he injured the finger in any other way. His
tetanus is up-to-date.  He is sure that he did not hit his head or pass
out.  He denies any shortness of breath.  He has no abdominal pain or low
back pain.  No other complaints. Secondarily, he is asking for detox.  He
was here last night for detox, but then changed his mind. He said given
that he was struck by a car riding away from the liquor store, he takes
this as a sign that he needs to get help with his alcoholism.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above. Otherwise completely reviewed as negative.

ALLERGIES:  NONE.

MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, alcohol abuse.

MEDICATIONS:  Unsure of the names.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for daily EtOH.

PHYSICAL:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 90, respiratory 22, blood
pressure 123/83, pulse oximetry 98% on room air.  In general, no distress.
Head:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to
light.  Mouth normal.  Ears normal.  Neck:  No midline point tenderness.
Full range of motion without pain.  Mild right paracervical muscle
tenderness and trapezius muscle tenderness.  Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1 and
S2.  Lungs:  Breath sounds are clear and equal bilaterally.  Chest wall and
ribs are nontender.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  Back:  No midline spine
tenderness.  No CVAT.  Pelvis:  Normal to palpation.  Extremities:  Full
range of motion all joints, no tenderness, bruising or deformity, no
evidence of trauma.  Skin:  The left index finger has a superficial wound
already healing by secondary intention. It is on the volar surface
overlying the distal phalanx. Neurovascularly intact distally.  Neuro:
Alert and oriented x3, moving all extremities, normal exam.  GCS equals
15.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  A code yellow standby was called because of
the mechanism of injury even though it has been 11 hours.  He had x-rays of
his right shoulder and cervical spine interpreted preliminarily by myself.
I have a very low suspicion for a spine injury.  His pain is really in the
right trapezius muscle.  The x-rays were preliminarily read by myself as
negative for any acute fracture or other abnormality. So, in terms of the
trauma, he is cleared. In terms of his alcohol abuse, screening labs were
sent.  CBC and electrolytes are fine.  His alcohol level was 230. So, he
slept in the ED for 4 hours.  I just checked on him again now at 5:30 a.m.
His alcohol level should be down and clinically he should be sober.  He
appeared sober when he first showed up any way, but he complains of nothing
new.  He says he feels fine.  His neck is still stiff and he is tired, but
otherwise he still wants help with detox.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post bicycle versus motor vehicle accident.
2. Neck strain.
3. Finger laceration.
4. Chronic alcoholism.

PLAN:  Disposition pending MHU evaluation. I anticipate discharge.

  ====================================================================================

PATIENT NAME:    Empress Stari        MR #: 01212050             DATE:  6/11/10     TIME:
9:30 A                       
 
CONSULT REQUESTED BY:    Dr Tuttle      
 
REASON FOR CONSULT:  SI             
 
CC/PRESENTING PROBLEM:     BIB Police after reporting seizure and SI
 
HPI:         Pt is a 29 yo F with unclear psychiatric history, reporting a diagnosis of
seizure disorder in the past.  She was reportedly brought in by police after flagging them
down while walking in Dedham. She reported she was homeless and then reported she was
suicidal.  In the ED, patient initially reported to RN that she reported SI to avoid being
put in the shelter by police.  She was intermittently cooperative, slept for a while, ate
some food.  She did not require any medications.  This AM, she was reevaluated and reported
recurrence of SI and asked to speak to psychiatry.  On interview, patient states she has
been staying at Wood Mullen shelter but yesterday was walking around and was attacked by a
man who forced her to smoke drugs.  States it was white stuff that she could not identify
but thinks it was cocaine and benzos.  Denies ever taking any drugs before.  States that she
has been sleeping well, eating well, denies feeling depressed.  Denies AVH, paranoia or HI. 
Reports that she is continuing to have suicidal ideation but denies having any plan or
intent to harm herself.  Requests an additional breakfast or lunch tray.
 
Per BEST, patietn has been seen 6/1, 6/3 and 6/8 of this year.  On 6/1 she was seen at BMC
after just being discharged from some EATS program (unclear where) after which she was
placed in partial hospital.  It appears that she went to the Carney.  On 6/3 she was seen at
the Carney PHP by the BEST team reporting SI and was hospitalized at Carney inpatient psych.
  It is unclear how long she stayed there.  On 6/8 she was brought in by ambulance to BMC ED
after being found wandering on the expressway, stating she was trying to be hit by a car. 
At that time, she reported discharge from Bayridge on 6/7.  Per eval on 6/8, pt has history
of reporting SI and then refusing to answer questions.  In the AM, she was noted to have SI
without plan and she was offered partial.  Unclear if she accepted this plan.  Prior to this
month, she was last seen by BEST 1 yr ago in 6/09.
 
  **note that patient was also seen at BWH under the name Empress Star BWH MRN 23988694:
Pt was seen 6/28, reporting recent seizure, requesting a prescription for Keppra.  She
refused exam, labs and left prior to completion of evaluation and thus did not get a
prescription for Keppra.  On 6/30, she represented to BWH ED, after again reporting seizure.
At that time, was shaking during the exam, but cognitvely intact, able to respond to
commands, thus her diagnosis of seizure disorder was questioned.  She denied any SI/HI/AVH
and eloped from the ED prior to psychiatric evaluation.

Psychiatry Discharge Summary

Admit date:  5/15/2017

Discharge date:  5/23/2017

Patient Information

Helena A Walsh, 38 y.o. female (DOB=     8/7/1978)

Code Status at Discharge:    Full Code (Presumed)

History of Present Illness:

For full details of admission, please see APS note by Mariel Marfongelli NP/Dr. John Tyson on 5/15/17 and

Emergency Medicine note by Dr. Lucas Marinaco on 5/5/17.

Ms. Walsh is 38yo female with medical history of DVT/PE currently on xarelto and possible prior posterior

CVA?/TIA v. vestibular migraine and   complex psychiatric history notable for multi-modal symptoms [carries

diagnoses of PTSD, OCD, depression w/psychotic features v. Schizoaffective disorder- depressive type] and

somatic presentations, history of intellectual disability, presenting with worsening depression, perceptual

disturbance, and ongoing headaches.

On Blake 11 interview, patient interviewed with mother present. Patient reports that she has not felt like herself

for at least a year. She reports multiple inpatient medical hospitalizations and outpatient specialist

consultations; most recently, she was admitted at Beverly Hospital 2-3 weeks prior to presentation. She reports

her primary issues are headache, vertigo a/w gait instability and falls, lightheadedness, epigastric pain and

nausea. She is in wheelchair because of the dizziness and imbalance. She reports feeling frustrated that none

of her hospitalizations or treatments have provided relief. Since her Beverly hospital discharge, she reports

feeling increasingly hopeless and demoralized about her persistent physical symptoms. Of note, she has not

seen her psychiatrist or therapist in months due to frequency of acute care hospitalizations. In this context, she

reports that she struggles with getting out of bed due to lack of motivation and low energy. She also reports

poor concentration. She reports her nausea and vertigo prohibit significant physical activity, and reports that

she misses being about to walk her dog. She denies significant changes in sleep or appetite. She denies

having suicidal thoughts or intent and denies prior suicide attempts.

Regarding psychotic symptoms, she reports that she has been struggling with worsening misperceptions over

the past month; it is unclear how much of these take place at baseline. She describes hearing whispers and

seeing frightening, vague shadows. She denies paranoia, fears of persecution, ideas of reference, fears of

poisoning, thought insertion, thought withdrawal, thought broadcasting.

Regarding PTSD symptoms, she reports prior criterion A trauma by sexual assault [rape by male known to her]

and endorses avoidance/agoraphobia, nightmares, flashbacks. She identifies unknown males, loud sounds,

and being touched unexpectedly to be triggers. She is able to de-escalate by being with people, listening to

music, and drawing.
Discharge Summaries by Stuart E Beck, MD at 5/22/2017                     7:39 AM (continued)

Regarding OCD symptoms, reports difficulty with hoarding behaviors and preoccupation with

symmetry/exactness [i.e. Has to write something repeatedly before she feels it "looks right"]. Historically

struggled with checking/rechecking, now in remission. No known history of compulsions associated with

cleanliness or counting.

She reports that she is motivated to feel better and will try to push herself to engage with the unit milieu. She

identifies strengths as being a good listener and good at drawing.

Axis IV: social isolation, unemployed

Axis V: 50

Assessment:

Patient is a 38 year old female with multiple acute care presentations/hospitalizations and functional decline

associated with multi-modal somatic symptoms who presented to the MGH ED on 5/15/17 with chief complaint

of persistent headache and found to have worsening perceptual disturbances and demoralization.

Diagnostically, given multiple, current, somatic symptoms that are distressing and impairing her ability to

function + persistent high level anxiety associated with her symptoms, suspect primary diagnosis of somatic

symptom disorder. With this diagnosis, it is important to note that her symptoms could very well be due to a

primary medical etiology, and the diagnosis does not obviate this possibility. However, given the atypical

quality of her presenting symptom [unremitting headache x 3-4 months with extensive negative workup and

multiple inpatient evaluations], would also consider that her headache is a somatic manifestation of her

emotional distress. In this context, patient might actually be struggling with primary PTSD, depression or

anxiety. The somatization could be driven by an environment where somatic complaints are more easily

noticed or more acceptable than the expression of emotional distress or negative feelings. Could also consider

role for patient's own difficulties with identifying and describing emotional distress verbally. For example, I

wonder if patient's diagnosis of intellectual disability renders her more vulnerable to alexithymia, leading to

somatization as a means to communicate distress. Regarding her reports of escalating misperceptions, it
Discharge Summaries by Stuart E Beck, MD at 5/22/2017  7:39 AM (continued)

sounds as though decline in mood preceded worsening perceptual disturbances. In this context, would

consider major depressive disorder with psychotic features. Differential includes schizoaffective disorder-

depressive type. Based on interview, patient also meets criteria for OCD and PTSD. Given her mother's

dominant role in assuming responsibility for most major areas of her life, I also question if patient has features

of dependent personality disorder.

Patient requires inpatient level of care for containment, diagnostic clarity, and after care coordination

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hospital Course

The patient was admitted to the locked inpatient, psychiatric unit on Blake 11 at MGH for further evaluation and

treatment of somatic symptom disorder. The patient was admitted under Section 10 legal status.             The attending

physician of record was Dr. Stuart Beck.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: The patient presented with the following issues on admission.

1. Primary psychiatric problem. Ms. Walsh presented with symptoms of depression with suicidal ideation,

anxiety, and somatic symptoms (headache, dizziness, and nausea) which prevented her from functioning

independently at home. She also described perceptual disturbances, both auditory (multiple voices whispering,

but she is unable to understand what is said) and visual (frightening black shadows coming toward her).

The patient?s somatic symptom disorder was addressed in a multimodal fashion. Several medications were

discontinued due to concern for polypharmacy: multivitamin, Topamax, Zofran, Reglan, Amitriptyline, Claritin,

Lactinex, Flonase, midrin. Her Zyprexa dose was decreased to 10mg due to concern for metabolic side effects.

Her Prozac was increased to 60mg to target depressive symptoms. She was started on Abilify to target

perceptual disturbances, and dose was uptitrated to 10mg daily. Anxiety and insomnia were treated with

hydroxyzine 50mg PRN. She continued on her home Depakote 500mg BID. Her headaches were treated with

Tylenol 650mg q6h PRN. Fioricet and meclizine were available PRN for migraines but were not required.

Ms. Walsh's somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety were also addressed through numerous

nonpharmacologic interventions. PT assessed her function and recommended outpatient vestibular PT. PT

also supported Ms. Walsh in walking with her Rollator on the uint, rather than using her wheelchair. OT worked

with Ms. Walsh to set functional goals including coloring and attending groups. OT also provided Ms. Walsh

with tools and training in improved independence with ADLs including lower body dressing.

At the time of discharge, Ms. Walsh showed improvement in her functional status, though her somatic

symptoms persist. She continues to have headaches, dizziness, and nausea during the day, and difficulty

sleeping and perceptual disturbances at night. Despite these symptoms, she was independent in ADLs with

only gentle encouragement, attended groups without cueing, and worked with PT to walk with her Rollator

instead of using her wheelchair. On admission she said that she had enjoyed drawing in the past but lately had

not been able to concentrate on drawing due to headaches; during her hospitalization she was able to color.

She expressed persistent fears about her mother's health and fear of losing her mother, but she was able to

tolerate nights in the hospital without her mother visiting. She described how she has been isolating herself due

to feeling depressed, but during this hospitalization she called her friend on the telephone. She is motivated to

walk so that she can walk her dog and visit her friend, and expresses willingness to work with vestibular PT to

reach this goal. She is interested in a day program to continue building distress tolerance and coping skills.

3. Medical issues. The patient?s medical status was stable throughout hospitalization.

#UTI: she was found to have positive urine culture (E. coli) with urinary urgency and frequency. She was

treated with a 3-day course of nitrofurantoin 100mg BID and did not require further intervention.

#History of DVT/PE: continue Xarelto 20mg

#Neurogenic bladder: continue oxybutynin 5mg BID

#Abdominal discomfort: treated with omeprazole 20mg with plan to restart home Dexilant 60mg daily after

discharge. Continued home sucralfate and ursodiol.
Discharge Summaries by Stuart E Beck, MD at 5/22/2017                   7:39 AM (continued)

#Diarrhea: intermittent loose stools were treated with imodium.

#Vitamin D deficiency: continue cholecalciferol 1000U daily

SAFETY ASSESSMENT

The patient was at elevated risk for self-harm on admission due to active symptoms (worsening depressive

symptoms, hallucinations, increasing fear over losing control), stressors (ongoing somatic complaints), and

other circumstances (multiple social stressors). However, since admission, the patient has has had

improvement of symptoms (improved mood, some improvement in hallucinations), and has had resolution of

acute stressors, including decreasing frequency and severity of the patient's headache and associated vertigo/

nausea.     The patient engaged in treatment (groups, individual work) on the unit, and has taken and tolerated

medications without problem.   Finally, over the course of the hospitalization, the patient became more hopeful,

more engaged, and more future-oriented, as evidenced by her commitment to continue working on CBT and

DBT skills she began working on during this hospitalization.

The patient is at chronically elevated risk for harm to self or others compared with general population due to

psychiatric illness, including chronic somatic symptom disorder, MDD with psychotic features, anxiety, and

PTSD; however, pt is protected by committed outpatient treaters, supportive family, and illness awareness.

Patient is motivated to continue outpatient psychiatric treatment. Patient is able to articulate a plan to reach out

for help from providers and family if symptoms worsen and to go to an emergency room or call 911 if feeling

unsafe. Therefore, the patient is not at acutely elevated risk of harm at this time and is appropriate for

outpatient level of care.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT
Mr. Cunningham is a 33yo man, PMH EtOH withdrawal (multiple
admissions, some c/b withdrawal seizures), opioid and benozodiazepine
abuse, p/w 1-day h/o tachycardia and SI. He was treated inpatient for
alcohol withdrawal and for suicide ideation. His presentation is not
very consistent with a primary psychotic disorder.

For his alcohol withdrawal, he was initially treated with lorazepam
3mg PO Q4H standing with 3mg PO Q2H PRN withdrawal symptoms, and he
took 13 mg of oral lorazepam for withdrawal in addition to 10 mg of
IV diazepam in the ED over the first 24 hours in the hospital. He was
more sedated after his initial, more agitated, presentation, but he
was easily arousable to voice and to light touch. His regimen was
reduced to eliminate the standing dose and to leave his PRN dose at
lorazepam 2mg PO Q4H, for which he only needed one dose. From 4 pm on
7/28 to 4 pm on 7/29, he only needed 2 mg lorazepam. Clonidine was
used in addition for management of withdrawal symptoms.

For his SI and psychiatric illness, he was continued on his home
doses of venlafaxine and olanzapine, and was placed on suicide
precautions. Per an inpatient psychiatry consultation, venlafaxine
was discontinued. He continues to endorse SI, so he remains on
suicide precautions.

For his other medical problems, namely his hypertension, GERD and
psoriasis, he was well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg PO QD,
omeprazole 20mg PO QD and clobetasol 0.05% TOP QD. They were well-
controlled throughout his hospitalization. He was given vitamin and
mineral supplementation with thiamine, folic acid, potassium and
magnesium.

Hypertension:
- Continue lisinopril 10 mg QD

Psoriasis:
- Consider outpatient referral to Dermatology

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  11/13/2011

DISCHARGING PHYSICIAN:  Kelly Burdge, M.D.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Weakness, likely secondary to dehydration.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post traumatic brain injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident
   in 2004.
2. Baseline unsteady gait secondary to traumatic brain injury.
3. Familiar hyperlipidemia.
4. Bipolar disorder.

HISTORY ON PRESENTATION:  The patient is a 23-year-old female with a
history as detailed above who had a fall from 5 steps, 3 days prior.  She
noticed generalized weakness with dizziness and lightheadedness and
unsteadiness of her feet when she was walking.  She states that she hit her
head, but did not lose consciousness.  She had no change in speech.  No
fevers or chills.  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, but came
in for further evaluation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Weakness.  The patient was admitted, given gentle IV
fluids overnight, and then felt improved in the daytime.  I personally
witnessed her gait in the hallway and while at her baseline unsteadiness,
she had no falls, no lightheadedness, and no focal neurologic defects.  Her
neurologic exam was at her baseline as well.  Her head CT was negative.
The patient felt much better overnight and I think it is reasonable to
discharge the patient to home.  She can arrange for outpatient followup
with her PCP this week.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Dear Ms. Long, 
You were admitted for convulsions. Luckily, you did not have any changes 
to your brain waves on your EEG, which means that your brain is healthy 
and is not seizing. Thus, we feel you do not need to be on anti-seizure 
medications, which could also be harmful for your baby.
You should continue to see your doctor to follow-up for your convulsions, 
and your Obgyn and follow-up with psychiatry as well.
Should you feel any worrisome symptoms again, please call your doctor 
immediately, who is the best person to recommend what measures to take at 
that time.
Neurology consult note
Reason for consult: sent from epilepsy clinic for LTM admission
HPI: (source: the patient; LMR notes, esp Dr. Klein's clinic note from 
today)
23RHF, 8weeks pregnant (EDC 10/30/09), PMH of nonepileptic spells, pt of 
Dr. Atumn Klein-- she was seeing Dr. Klein today and apparently had a 
convulsion in the office; EMS was called, and she was sent to BWH ED. Dr. 
Klein contacted the neurology ED covering resident and asked that she be 
admitted for LTM to characterize these events. They are thought to be 
pseudoseizures based on PMH. See detailed clinic note from Dr. Klein 
today for details. 
Summary from today's clinic note: 
-currently about 8 weeks pregnant EDC 10/30/09
-today's visit was for increasing convulsions in the setting of 
pregnancy. 
-off ativan, tegretol, triletpal since finding out she was pregnant; has 
been on Keppra
-in past week has had 7 sz, worst = 7min long
-says these are from sleep or resting; R arm shakes then leg; sometims at 
school has had drop sz and GTCs; loses bladder control
-typically gets aura of metallic taste in her mouth
-usually confused for <1h after events
-freq 2-3/week since Oct 2008 after bus accident
-also says faince's mother has seen events of staring + unresponsiveness 
-she had LTM monitoring at BWH, during events no sz activity on EEG -> dx 
of NES
-seizures started age 16 after hit by by drunk driver; she went through 
windshield, blacked out; no recall of event x h after; sz started 6mo 
later; first was a convulsive one (body shaking, eyes rolled back in 
head)
-was started on CBZ which seemed to control sz for a while, but age 21 
they began happening regularly w/ R arm shaking, and since then are

several recent ED visits for these. These new spells are typical of those 
captured previously and found to be non-electrographic seizures during 
her prior LTM admission, and so are suspected to also be NES. However, to 
be sure, and b/c of her multiple ED visits, she is being admitted for 
monitoring including LTM to re-characterize the spells. Given low 
suspicion that these are genuine sz's and current pregnancy, will be use 
AEDs tonight conservatively-- no change in current med dose.

HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to the neurology service.
1. Neurological:
Keppra was held, as there was consideration that the patient had NES.
She underwent a 1 day LTM EEG which showed normal EEG, no events 
recorded, no epileptiform abnormalities.
The patient did not feel as if she was having any seizures. We did speak 
to her at length about the risks of continuing on AEDs given that she was 
pregnant, and she was agreeable to stopping Keppra.
She was also seen by phsychatry. They felt she had PTSD in remission
And suggested minimizing psychotropic exposure.
2. OBGyn:
The patient was complaining of abdominal pain in the upper abdominal 
area, which irradiated to the lower abdomen and groin. She was seen by 
Obgyn, and had an obstetrical US done. The US showed viable intrauterine 
fetus.  
On the day of discharge, the patient was clinically stable, VSS, 
neurological and general physical examinations unremarkable. He has 
instructions to follow-up in neurology, Obgyn clinic and with psychiatry.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Ms. Long, 
You were admitted for convulsions. Luckily, you did not have any changes 
to your brain waves on your EEG, which means that your brain is healthy 
and is not seizing. Thus, we feel you do not need to be on anti-seizure 
medications, which could also be harmful for your baby.
You should continue to see your doctor to follow-up for your convulsions, 
and your Obgyn and follow-up with psychiatry as well.
Should you feel any worrisome symptoms again, please call your doctor 
immediately, who is the best person to recommend what measures to take at 
that time.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN: 
Follow-up NES care.

Hospital Course

Stephen Roberts is a 39 y.o. male with T1DM and prior IVDU (c/b recurrent MSSA infections including

osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, recurrent L hip septic arthritis s/p multiple surgeries), who presented to MGH

with R hand pain following an assault, with a 2 day history of L pain pain, erythema and swelling.

Please see below for complete H&P. In brief, Stephen M Roberts is a 39 year old man with a history of T1DM,

prior IVDU, who presented to MGH after AMAing from BMC with thumb dislocation and left finger cellulitis

=================================

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM

=================================

# Cellulitis.  He presented with warmth, erythema, edema, and pain in his left finger, as well as pain in his right

thumb after injury.  He first presented to BMC where his thumb dislocation was reduced, but left AMA for MGH.

He had received one dose of vanc/cefepime at BMC.     At MGH he had an XR of the hand that showed old

fractures.     Labs showed a creatinine at his recent baseline (1.1), a normal white count at 9.2, and normal ESR.

Blood cultures were NGTD on discharge.    Plastic surgery was consulted out of concern for flexor tenosynovitis

but felt that this was less likely.  He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for cellulitis and his symptoms

improved.      He was discharged on 10 days of cefadroxil ending 2/24.

-- Doxy 100 mg BID (chronic suppressive therapy)

-- Cefadorxil 1000 mg daily through 2/24

# T1DM.       He has a history of T1DM with prior admissions for DKA, last A1c in 6/2018 was 8.7    Here he noted

that he has had some "low" readings in the morning (40s-60s) that he is not symptomatic from.       He was

continued on his home Lantus with wide range in glucoses (80-500). Although glucoses not under perfect

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL

=================================

Stephen Roberts is a 39 y.o. male with T1DM and prior IVDU (c/b recurrent MSSA infections including

osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, recurrent L hip septic arthritis s/p multiple surgeries), who presented to MGH

with R hand pain following an assault, with a 2 day history of L pain pain, erythema and swelling.

He first became unwell on the morning of Feb 12th, when upon waking that morning he noted erythema,

swelling and pain of his left index finger. He count not recall and trauma or break to the skin in that area

preceding. He did not seek medical care at this time, and was systemically well with no fevers, chills or rigors,

no nausea or vomiting.

He was then assaulted in the early hours of Feb 14th when out with his girlfriend by 3-4 men who reportedly

did not have weapons and struck him in the head with fists 2-3 times. He sustained a bloody nose, lost one of

his bottom teeth and sustained a black left eye. In attempting to block a punch, he dislocated his inter-

phalangeal joint of his right thumb.

He then presented to BMC with R hand pain and had reduction of his dislocated IP joint. They were also

concerned for left index finger cellulitis +/- early tenosynovitis and so he received 1 dose of IV

vancomycin/CTX, however he then left AMA and came to MGH as he gets his primary care here.

Prior to these issues, he has been well with no night sweats, weight loss, malaise or dyspnea. He informs me

he has not used illicit drugs in 20 years, although his urine toxicology on admission is positive for cocaine. He

reports frequent hypoglycemic episodes at home, and his fasting BG most mornings is in the 50-60's range. He

estimates that he has needed assistance from his girlfriend 20 times in the past year with providing him high-

sugar drinks or IM glucagon on 2 occasions. He has not presented to hospital for management of

hypoglycemia, however. He is not sure why he is having recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, such as double-

dosing or not eating, it is concerning that he says he does not feel symptoms of hypoglycemia until he is in the

20-30's.

Hospital Course

Chief Complaint/Reason for Admission: suicidal ideation with COVID positivity

History of Present Illness:

Mr. Benedicto Portillo is a 41 yo M with history of severe EtOH use disorder (c/b alcoholic hallucinosis,

withdrawal, gastritis, cirrhosis), depression, and previous suicide attempt who presented with several hours of

chest pain.

Recent history begins this morning when Mr. Portillo reports onset of chest pain prompting him to go to

EBNHC, at which time he reported to staff that he wanted to hit and kill himself. He was placed on section 12

and sent to MGH ED where he continued to endorse SI, reportedly hitting himself in head on arrival to ED. He

also endorsed drinking alcohol today, reports multiple stressors including the death of 2 friends from COVID

and the anniversary of his wife's death. He was seen by Psychiatry in the ED who felt his presentation

consistent with "exacerbation of his alcohol use disorder and overwhelmed coping skills". He was found at that

time not to meet Section 12 criteria given that his SI and desire for self-harm were both intermittently occurring

in the context of intoxication, and was recommended to be referred for detox placement.

He reports that his chest pain is anterior, non-radiating, non-pleuritic, and does not worsen with exertion.        He

has had no associated shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or cough. No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.           Upon

sobering he recanted suicidal comments and is now interested in detox but has been found to be COVID

positive. He then expressed desire to go to detox and rehab but in the context of COVID positivity could not be

placed. He is now admitted to medicine for EtOH withdrawal and will await placement.

Psych history per note from Dr. Judith Restrepo (see Note dated 03-03-2020 for further description):

"41 y.o. male from El Salvador with Alcohol use disorder complicated by cirrhosis, alcohol related hallucinosis,

and reported complicated withdrawal, and depressive symptoms, greater than 30 lifetime psychiatric

hospitalizations, pattern of repeated ED visits, and self injurious behavior as well as suicidal gesture via

ingestion who self presented to the ED with suicidal ideation in the setting of alcohol intoxication. The patient

expressed feeling depressed int he setting of stopping all of his medications and not following up with

outpatient psychiatric care as recommended. These events led to the patient being admitted to the inpatient

psychiatric unit for safety, containment and crisis stabilization further evaluation, and treatment of alcohol

intoxication and withdrawal."

Discharge instructions and important events and results

Activity: WBAT LLE in cylindrical cast, windowed for wound checks

Analgesia: Standard regimen

Anticoagulation: Lovenox 40 mg qd while inpt, ASA 325mg daily at dc to rehab

Medications: Please resume your pre-operative medications as directed

By the prescribing physician(s). You should take an extra strength tylenol (500 mg vs 650 mg depending on

the brand you buy) every 6 hours for 10 days. This will help with baseline pain control.  You have been given

a prescription for a narcotic pain medication, oxycodone 5 mg tablets. You can take 1-2 tablets every 4-6

hours as needed for pain.. Stop taking this medication as soon as your pain allows. Please take a stool

softener (such as Colace) if taking narcotic pain medications to reduce your symptoms of constipation. Do

not drive, drink alcohol or operate machinery while taking narcotic medication.

Call Dr. Richardson's office, your PCP or go to the ER if you develop fevers (>101.5)/chills, redness around

your incision that is warm and tender to the touch, numbness or tingling in the hand, increasing pain that

doesn't improve with rest and pain medication at the prescribed dose, or any other symptoms that concern

you.

DATE OF SERVICE:        04/29/2020

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:             This is a 43-year-old, divorced white female with a long history of poorly

defined chronic mental illness, CBFS services in place, multiple historical diagnoses, including an unspecified

depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, unspecified eating disorder, PTSD, dissociative identity

disorder as well as a medical history significant for chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of around

1.3, hypothyroidism, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, GERD, and medication-induced lupus, on chronic steroids,

multiple recent psychiatric hospitalization here at Newton Wellesley, last discharged approximately 12 days

ago, multiple prior suicide attempts by ingestion, last approximately 3 years ago, history of    subjectively

reported self-injurious behaviors, primarily by stating she has pulled out her hair and eyelashes as well as

toenails, though never any physical evidence of such, currently under outpatient psychiatric care, who once

again self-presents to Newton-Wellesley Hospital ED initially in the company of her roommate, once again with

chief complaint of worsening depression and suicidal ideation with plan to overdose on prescribed medication

in the context of multiple ongoing psychosocial stressors.    The patient is well-known to me from many prior

evaluations.

The patient tells me that her main stressor right now is that following her last discharge she went to live with a

previous girlfriend.  This apparently did not work out very well.  It was conflictual from the beginning.     And

yesterday the patient received an email stating that this other person wanted nothing more to do with the

patient.  This caused the patient then to start ruminating once again suicide, specifically thoughts of overdosing

on her prescribed medications.  She denies that she has done so.         She has since moved back with her current

and longtime roommate, with whom there has always been some odd relationship.          However, her mood has

been spiraling over the past 24 hours.  She did contact her longtime outpatient psychiatrist earlier this evening,

who recommended she return to the ED.

In addition to this recent trauma, the patient did have to go to the emergency room at Beth Israel 8 days ago for

work-up of chest pain.    She was noted to have a pericardial effusion.  She was placed on colchicine and will

follow-up as an outpatient.

In addition to the above acute stress she reports continuing to struggle with multiple unresolved prior more

chronic stressors. These include the deaths of her grandmother and therapy cat almost 3 years ago, ongoing

trauma-focused psychotherapy, and the loss of the support network she had when she used to attend Potter's

Place day program before getting her recent job.  She tells me that she has been taking increasing amounts of

her prescribed medications.  She also tells me she has once again been pulling toenails and fingernails off,

although they do seem completely intact on examination today.      She also tells me she believes she has gained

about 30 pounds in the past 2 months.

The patient denies current homicidal ideation.    She has lost about 5 pounds over the past week.  She has not

been sleeping very well.     She denies any symptoms consistent with psychosis or mania.       She does report an

increase in nightmares and flashbacks from sexual trauma suffered as a child. No medication changes since

discharge.    She denies any significant substance use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:         Per HPI.

PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:        The patient has had multiple prior psychiatric hospitalizations, including several in a

row recently here at Newton Wellesley Hospital over the past month and a half. She first came into contact

with the mental healthcare system in her 20s.  She was hospitalized in New York City at that time.         She has

had several hospitalizations since then. She has been hospitalized at Newton-Wellesley at least 7 times,

typically in the context of depression and suicidal ideation. She has had multiple suicidal gestures by

ingestion, also by self strangling and one report of attempted carbon monoxide poisoning. There are no

available details of these last 2 attempts.

As noted, she carries multiple historical psychiatric diagnoses including depression, borderline personality

disorder, PTSD, and dissociative identity disorder as well as an unspecified eating disorder. Her current

psychiatrist is Dr. Mark Gloss and her therapist is Brenda Bemporad. She used to attend a Riverside day

treatment program 3 days a week, but has not been able to secondary to her part-time job. She does have

CBFS services in place.

I could find no significant substance use history. The patient does report significant trauma history as a child.

States she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse by her father and that she continues to suffer chronic

PTSD symptoms from this.

SOCIAL HISTORY:         The patient is originally from Dracut, Massachusetts.  She grew up there initially to an

intact family.  She states, however, that her parents were always in conflict and that her mother slept on the

couch and her father in the bedroom. She describes her father as a "philanderer." Parents divorced when she

was 14.    She has 1 younger brother.    As noted, she reports repeated physical and sexual abuse at the hands

of her father growing up. The patient attended public schools. She briefly attended Endicott College on the

North Shore and then briefly attended community college, but never obtained any degree.

The patient tells me that when she was a young adult that she "had a fit," and went down to New York City

hoping to be hospitalized psychiatrically. She described this as "a terrible experience," and so came back up to

the Boston area.  She has been living primarily in Waltham since then.         She has worked variously in retail, has

not had any significant lengthy work history, most recently he had worked as a front desk person at a local

Hilton in Waltham; still collects SSDI.  Not currently working.  She seems to have little by way of any

meaningful day structure.

She was in and out of hospitals in her 20s and 30s. She met her wife in this setting; describes her wife as

having had significant psychiatric issues.   They met approximately 7 years ago, got married 3-1/2 years ago

before the marriage ended rather abruptly. The patient is still resentful that "I did not get anything out of that

marriage." There was a prenuptial agreement.

Since then, the patient has been living with a female roommate whom she met at one of her treatment

programs; states at that time she was a director. She describes this woman as having Asperger's syndrome

and many "sensory issues."  This relationship as well has been somewhat tumultuous at times.             She denies

any romantic component to this. She describes her living situation otherwise as "stable." She has never had

children.  She states that her wife was at least 12 years older than she was.  She has no contact with her

brother and father, both of whom are alive and still live together in Dracut.

Discharge Summary by Roger L Greiger, MD at 5/12/2020 12:12 PM (continued)

disorder as well as a medical history significant for chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of around

1.3, hypothyroidism, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, GERD, and medication-induced lupus, on chronic steroids,

multiple recent psychiatric hospitalization here at Newton Wellesley, last discharged approximately 12 days

ago, multiple prior suicide attempts by ingestion, last approximately 3 years ago, history of        subjectively

reported self-injurious behaviors, primarily by stating she has pulled out her hair and eyelashes as well as

toenails, though never any physical evidence of such, currently under outpatient psychiatric care, who once

again self-presents to Newton-Wellesley Hospital ED initially in the company of her roommate, once again with

chief complaint of worsening depression and suicidal ideation with plan to overdose on prescribed medication

in the context of multiple ongoing psychosocial stressors.

The patient will be admitted to 3 East on a conditional voluntary for acute stabilization of debilitating depression

and suicidality.  I will continue her outpatient medications for now.  I will order fasting labs for the a.m.      I will

make p.r.n. medications available for anxiety and insomnia and I will defer further management to the primary

team.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Houston 3 after it was determined that she was medically

cleared in our emergency room.   She signed in on condition voluntary, was put on 15-minute checks for safety

and restarted on her outpatient medication regimen.

The patient is well-known to Newton Wellesley Hospital and me from prior hospitalizations.           When I first met

with the patient she acknowledged feeling extremely depressed and reported that she had not felt this way in

years.  She also reported binging on food and has gained weight which is a concern for her as she usually

presents with food restriction.

As per prior admissions initially the patient spent the first couple of days isolative in her room however little by

little over the course of admission she began to attend all groups with appropriate participation.    She often

sought out staff to discuss her issues which she found quite helpful.  The patient set a goal for discharge on the

day that she had an appointment at BI-Deaconess for her infusion treatments.            However on Mother's Day the

patient took a brief setback as she acknowledged having conflictual issues with her deceased mother.               On the

following day she did attend at least 3 groups and on the day of discharge the patient reported that she had

bounced back and was eager and ready for discharge.         Again as the patient improved and is not at imminent

danger to herself or others and fully capable of seeking out help should she feel unsafe discharge planning

occurred.

Of this 30 minute visit, greater than 50% was spent counseling about and/or coordinating care of her

depression as well as discussing discharge planning..

PATIENT NAME:  Leroe, Ruth                  MR:  00-89-38-39

DATE OF ADMISSION:  11/14/2007              BILLING NUMBER:  1041734714

EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN:  Michael Walger, M.D.

TIME OF VISIT:  2205.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  MVC.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 24-year-old female who was
involved in a high-speed MCV on Route 128.  There was some driver's side
impact.  The patient was restrained in a seat belt with no LOC, no nausea
or vomiting.  She did not hit her head.  She did not hit her chest.  She
got out of the car and was walking around the area of the accident prior to
ambulance personnel getting on the scene.  The patient refused C-spine
precautions.  She was brought into the emergency room.  She is 20 weeks
pregnant.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A complete review of systems is otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C.

MEDICATIONS:  Methadone.

ALLERGIES:  NONE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Beverly.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 150/88, heart rate
of 108, respiratory rate of 16, temperature is 98.  General:  The patient
is alert and responds to questions.  She is tearful here in the emergency
room.  She has no C-, T- or L-spine tenderness, no chest wall tenderness.
No blood in the ears, nose, and throat.  Chest exam:  Heart regular rate
and rhythm.  Lungs good breath sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, normal
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Radial and
distal pulses 2+ bilaterally.  Neurological exam:  Within normal limits.
She has no chest wall tenderness, no abdominal tenderness, no pelvic
tenderness.  Skin:  No rash, no excoriations, no bruises.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Here in the emergency room, I did a fast
scan.  I first of all did an ultrasound of the pregnancy.  Good fetal heart
rate of 140s.  I did a fast scan.  No free fluid was seen.  We observed the
patient here in the emergency room for 2 hours.  I had a lengthy
conversation with the patient as she started escalating after her mother
apparently drove by the emergency room.  Her mother was going to give her a
ride home and did not stop to check on the patient but kept driving.  The
patient was escalating.  After I was able to redirect her, she redirected,
answered my questions calmly.  She did state that, in the past, she has had
problems with depression and is currently seeing a therapist.  Her next
therapist appointment is tomorrow.  She goes to school for graphic design
on Newbury Street, and she plans to go home to a house that she shares with
a roommate in Beverly tonight and go to sleep when she gets home.  She does
not feel a danger to herself.  She has had cutting behavior before but
denies any of this tonight and denies that this accident was intentional
and says this was, indeed, an accident where she hit the barrier with the
driver's side of her car.

DIAGNOSIS:  Here in the emergency room, the diagnosis was motor vehicle
crash.  The patient had an episode of agitation that resolved with some
crying here in the emergency room.  She does have a past history of
depression in reviewing her medical record.  She has a history of
depression and borderline personality.

DISPOSITION:  She was instructed for signs and symptoms for urgent
evaluation in the ER and she walked in the emergency room without any
problems.  Condition was stable.

02:59 Differential Diagnosis Reported sexual assault. Given report     mar2
      head trauma as well as presence of headache and nausea, will         
      obtain head CT to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. Regarding        
      her low back pain, there is no midline spine tenderness to           
      concern for bony injury, the areas of tenderness correspond to       
      muscular pain. Regarding her right-sided rib pain, I am not          
      concerned for rib fracture and plain films are not indicated.        
      Evidence collection kit done, please refer to HPI for specifics.     
      The patient is amenable to post exposure prophylaxis for             
      gonorrhea, Chlamydia, trichomonas, pregnancy, as well as HIV; we     
      will administer all of these in the ED. Tetanus is up-to-date. .     
03:24 Data reviewed: vital signs, nurses notes, lab test result(s),    mar2
      radiologic studies, and as a result, I will discharge patient.       
      ED course: CT head was negative for acute intracranial injury.       
      CBC, chemistries, and LFTs were notable for hematocrit of 33.6       
      which is patient's baseline. Patient will be discharged to her       
      home with a prescription of doxycycline, as well as a three-day      
      supply of Truvada and Kaletra. I have counseled her on need to

dichorionic-diamniotic gestation with shortened cervix.  She
presented to the labor and delivery triage unit complaining of
nausea and vomiting for two days, inability per p.o. in context
of suspected gastroenteritis.  She was noted to contract every 2
minutes on toco, however, appeared comfortable and did not
proceed with contractions.  Digital exam demonstrated fingertip dilation,
50% effaced, cervix without tension on the cerclage.  Ultrasound
obtained demonstrated a cervical length of 1.2 cm with internal
os open.  Finally, previous ultrasound on 12/12/06 demonstrated
1.6-cm cervical length.  In terms of her gastroenteritis, she
reported one to two days history of nausea and vomiting and
watery, nonbloody diarrhea.  She denied sick contacts, fever,
chills and dysuria.  White count was notable at 16 with no polys. UA was 
suggestive of potential UTI with white blood cells.  Ms. Wanzo was admitted to 
the fuller antepartum service for bed rest, observation and repeat course of 
betamethasone administration. She had been previously received a course of 
betamethasone in the

the antepartum service floor for shortened cervix noted on
ultrasound.  In the context of her gestational age and twin
gestation it was felt that the cervical length was appropriate
was stable and there is no evidence of preterm labor.  Plan was
to followup remainder to follow dilation with a degree of
cervical exams.  Ms. Wanzo's contractions were likely in the

Hospital Course

Anjole West is a 36 y.o. female with a history of alcohol and benzo use disorders (with history of withdrawal

seizures), opiate use disorder (on methadone), PTSD, anxiety who was transferred to MGH from the Quincy

Steward Satellite Emergency Facility after intubation for airway protection in the setting of refractory seizures in

the setting of likely benzo withdrawal.

#AMS: Her course was complicated by persistent altered mental status, most notable for a significant degree of

short term memory loss. She had two MRIs which showed restricted diffusion and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity

involving the bilateral hippocampi, amygdala and and mesial temporal lobes and possibly the crura of the

fornices, consistent with excitotoxic injury or possibly related to toxic effects due to opioid abuse. She had a

MOCA score of 16 on 5/16, 22 on 5/20, and 24 on 5/22; delayed recall remained profoundly impaired

throughout however.   Neurology and psychiatry were consulted for her mental status. Given that she had been

on clonazepam with questionable use patterns (ie: overuse, etc), there was a strong desire to not put her back

                                                                        ADM: 5/9/2018  D/C: 5/23/2018

on that medication. A trial of IV ativan was given on 5/20 to see if her anxiety would decrease to a point where

her thoughts could be more organized and her memory improve, but her immediate short term memory did not

improve much and her anxiety was essentially unchanged. Psychiatry started Zoloft and 12.5 mg seroquel

nightly; the patient and her mother noted prior poor reactions (strange behavior) to Zoloft at age 11 but

psychiatry felt safe to continue. Currently at 100 mg zoloft daily and should continue to uptitrate as outpatient

by 50 mg per week to goal of 200-300 mg daily. Finally, pt was noted to have elevated LFTs and INR thought

to be 2/2 HCV (as discussed below) and ammonia was noted to be elevated to 74. Lactulose was started with

improvement in ammonia to 36 on 5/18, and may have played a role.

[] Up titrate zoloft 50 mg daily / week until goal of 200-300 mg daily

[] continue 12.5 mg Seroquel nightly

[] Continue lactulose BID

#Seizures: Initially presented to Quincy ED with seizures. She was given ativan, versed, phenobarb, keppra

and magnesium without resolution of seizures. She was intubated and started on propofol and transferred to

MGH. LP cell counts from Quincy ED: CSF clear, 2 whites, 4 reds, 1 lymph, 1 poly, glucose 56, total protein

27.0. CT head did not show any acute intracranial lesions and EEG was non epileptiform. Pt was started on

and completed a phenobarb taper. After her MICU stay she was transferred to the floor. No seizures were

observed and neurology evaluated and recommended no AEDs.

#Dispo: Given her severely reduced mental capacity from a short term memory perspective, there were

significant concerns that she could not appropriately care for herself. Collateral from mother during discussion

on 5/19: she was living with friends Roger and Donna prior this admission. She has a boyfriend Kevin in

Quincy who is abusive to her, thinks the boyfriend gave her the bruises. Patient's husband was arrested two

years ago for domestic abuse and then was assaulted in jail and has since been in the hospital (2 years) with a

trach and G tube. The patient cannot remember if he is alive or not but was asking about his life insurance

policy. For much of admission, pt required substantial assistance with basic tasks, as above her MOCA was

16/30, and she required disposition including 24 hour care. She improved substantially over the last 5 days of

her admission, with a MOCA on 10/23 of 27/30. On 5/22 and 5/23, psychiatry assessed that pt had capacity to

make decisions about her disposition. She strongly emphasized her decision to return to Roger and Donna's

home rather than to a SNF. She was able to explain an understanding that she has memory deficits that could

lead to substantial harm if she does not have assistance managing her medications, appointments, and other

elements of care. She plans to engage Roger and Donna in her care, and they confirmed to writer that they

understand the need to provide supervision and assistance. They stated that they are able to provide

supervision for 24 hours a day and can help her get her medications from pharmacy, take those medications,

and attend appointments with PCP and at methadone clinic. While a SNF may be a safer environment, pt had

capacity and a comprehensive plan, and was discharged to the care of Roger and Donna.

notes available in care everywhere, she often showed up to visits obtunded under the influence of clonazepam

dose was confirmed by her methadone clinic at Bay Cove. Last dose letter provided on day of discharge.

#Hepatits C: Ms West has a known diagnosis of hepatitis C. She preferred not to have follow up scheduled

elevated over this admission and right upper quadrant US on 5/9 did demonstrate heterogeneous and

echogenic liver c/w steatosis. Patient placed on lactulose, as above, and should continue given elevated

On exam, the patient reports two to three weeks of depressed mood and SI, 
becoming unbearable such that today she says,  I couldn t take it anymore  and 
decided to commit suicide by overdosing on 3g heroin, 5 Klonopin and 2 other 
benzodiazepine pills. She did not tell anyone after taking the overdose, but 
presented to the ED with the hope of obtaining inpatient treatment and detox. 
While in the ED, she says,  I still don t want to live , and endorses ongoing SI
with plan to overdose if released into the community. She reports no barriers to
suicide other than being unable to afford a fatal dose of heroin, and says she 
has no one in her life currently with whom she is able to discuss how she is 
feeling. She endorses daily drug taking both 1-2g of heroin daily and total dose
Klonopin or Xanax 3-5 mg/day.
 
Though she was hospitalized at Arbour Hospital in June, Ms. Toscano reports 
receiving no benefit from the treatment at that time. She says prior 
hospitalizations have  helped , but she has no outpatient psychiatric support at
the moment. Per LMR, she did at one point see a resident at St. E s for some 
time, but stopped when that person moved on and has not established other 
treaters. On exam today, Ms. Toscano denies this. She does report taking her 
prescribed Wellbutrin and Seroquel as instructed, though she is nearly out of 
her prescription as she has only received them while hospitalized.
 
Ms. Toscano is currently homeless, sleeping at various friends  houses, some of 
whom she says are also substance users. She says these friends  make it easier 
for me to use , but does not feel they are trying to harm her or otherwise 
influencing her. She repeatedly denies feelings that anyone is out to harm her, 
and she denies HI. Ms. Toscano also denies ever experiencing A/VH, delusions or 
paranoia.
 
She also denies symptoms of mania ever in her life, including decreased need for
sleep, racing thoughts or speech and irritability. She does endorse impulsivity,
described as,  I go to the store and buy anything . She also endorses a history 
sexual abuse by her brother at age 10 for which she did not receive treatment. 
Ms. Toscano reports relatively good sleep and appetite.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is the first known 7-East, but at least
the sixth psychiatric admission since age 14 for this 26-year-old homeless,
sporadically employed white female who has been homeless and "living
everywhere" since she was paroled from Framingham MCI (September 2011 after
serving 14 months for breaking and entering) after which, she went to her
parents' home in Florida (Frank Forgione III, 781-254-3439; Barbara).
While there, she relapsed to prescription opiates, in the context of a
history of using opiates since age 18 and heroin since age 23, and then
relocated to Massachusetts where she has been using heroin daily, smoking
marijuana daily, using benzodiazepines whenever she can get them and
prostituting to support her habit (which she has been doing since age 18
when she first started using opiates).  She has been drinking since age 12,
smoking marijuana since age 16.  She reports that she is hepatitis C virus
negative, HIV negative, tested in prison, not sharing needles now and does
not want to be tested, five psychiatric admissions since age 14 (the first
time "I went crazy on my parents" when intoxicated).  The only time that
she is abstaining from drugs and alcohol was when she was in prison.  She
is one of three siblings with two brothers (Tommy, 23; Frank, 25, who has a
girlfriend Alicia, they live in Lynn, but the patient cannot stay with them
because they live in a studio apartment and "no room").  Both brothers have
been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, but she does not know a
diagnosis and neither parent uses drugs or alcohol.  One brother is a
former heroin user.  She states that she has been using IV heroin since age
23 and using continuously, except when she is in prison and has never been
on methadone or Suboxone.

She was admitted on conditional voluntary from the Union Hospital Emergency
Department where she presented by ambulance at 15:06 hours on February 7,
2012 with a chief complaint of being "suicidal and homicidal" in the
context of using OxyContin, Percocet, IV drugs and heroin "whatever I can
get my hands on," and "living on the street," with a blood pressure of
127/70, pulse 82, afebrile, no formulated plan for suicide or homicide,
complaining of depression, but no nausea, vomiting, palpitations or
shortness of breath and states she last used heroin on the day of
presentation to the emergency room and states that she had been living with
a man who had drinking problems and now has no place to stay, had homicidal
ideation towards that man.

In the emergency room, WBC 9.9, hemoglobin 13.1, hematocrit 37.0, MCV 89.1,
MCH elevated at 31.6, MCHC 35.4, platelets 187,000, absolute neutrophil
count elevated at 9.31, no bands, relative neutrophilia.  Sodium 139,
potassium low at 3.3, chloride 107, bicarb 24, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7 and
random glucose elevated at 198.  HIV negative in November 2008, hepatitis C
negative in November 2008, beta HCG apparently not done with blood alcohol
level undetectable and urine drug screen positive for benzodiazepines,
marijuana and opiates.

In the course of this evaluation, I interviewed the patient, reviewed both
my consultation of January 30, 2012 and Dr. Karmacharya's consultation of
January 29, 2012.

Dr. Karmacharya saw the patient on January 29, 2012 when she presented with
polysubstance abuse, a history of bipolar disorder and increasing
depression and suicidal ideation, reporting that she had been on Haldol,
Elavil and bupropion in prison, did not follow up with health care in
Florida, relapsed to opiates, was using daily IV heroin since relocating up
from Florida on approximately January 18, 2012, and reported suicidal
ideation with plans to run in front of a car.  She reports a previous
diagnosis of bipolar disorder with previous admission to BayRidge (2012).
She states that she would use heroin preferentially, but Percocet and
Vicodin when she could not get it and would use marijuana and
benzodiazepines when they were available.  Single, never married, and she
was monitored for opiate and benzodiazepine withdrawal.

I saw the patient the following day.

I saw the patient on January 30, 2012 and at that time, she presented to
the Salem emergency room stating that she had been depressed with insomnia,
using IV heroin daily, reported suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose.
She was calm, in good control, recanted suicidal ideation, no manic or
psychotic symptoms were noted, and course in the emergency room was
uneventful.  She has a history of previous presentation to the Salem
Hospital Emergency Room on June 15, 2010 where she presented abusing heroin
and wanting detox, denied suicidal ideation and was discharged home.

On July 10, 2010, approximately one month later, she had been out with her
brother the night before, used heroin and Xanax, woke up in the morning and
could not find her brother, looked in the window of her ex-boyfriend's
house and he called the police and she was arrested and, while she was
having her photograph taken, grabbed a wire, put it around her neck, no
injury was done, but she was brought to the emergency room for a suicide
gesture in the process of being arrested.  She was calm and cooperative
after given being given IM Haldol which was given because she was
belligerent and spitting and she was discharged to police custody.

To my evaluation, she was alert, attentive, well-healed scar on her left
arm ("I cut myself while I was in prison"), denied suicidal or homicidal
ideation, no delusions, wanted to be discharged, accepts information about
the risks of prostitution ("I'm always careful, I use a condom") and wanted
a prescription for Haldol and to be discharged to the home of her brother
and sister-in-law (would not disclose her brother's name, "I used to call
him Frizzle").

The current episode of care occurs against the background of a family
history of unspecified psychiatric disorder in both brothers, using heroin
with one brother who also uses heroin, drinking since age 12, smoking
marijuana since age 16, abusing opiates since age 18, prostituting since
age 18 to support this habit, injecting heroin since age 23.

The patient appears much more demoralized than when I saw her on January
30th, 2012, describing "I have nowhere to go," wanting to return to
Florida, but does not have the requisite 200 dollars, appearing quite
sedated.  There is no mydriasis or piloerection, she does not endorse
suicidal ideation on the unit, gives a history of relief-cutting and a
suicide attempt in jail 18 months ago by hanging.

She reports more than 10 arrests, assault and battery, breaking and
entering, prostitution, marijuana possession.

She reports being kicked out of her parents' home after a disagreement and
moved back to Massachusetts, got in an argument with a man who was making
sexual advances towards her.  She did not appear to be suicidal in the
emergency room, but reported ideation to cut her wrists with a razor or
jump in front of a car or overdose on heroin and homicidal ideation to
strangle a man with whom she had been staying.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:  As above.

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  As above.

FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  As above.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Never been pregnant, has both HIV and hepatitis C
risk factors, last tested in prison 18 months ago, does not share needles
now and states she uses a condom when she prostitutes.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  As above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A healthy-appearing white female with a scar on the
left forearm.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive.  No mydriasis.  Neck
is supple with full range of motion.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft and
nontender.  Extremities are normal and there is no piloerection although
she does have needle tracks in her left antecubital fossa.  Cranial nerves
2-12 are intact.

MENTAL STATUS EXAM:  Sedated, dysphoric, demoralized, attentive,
continuously related, recalls me from the emergency room, very demoralized
with no plan and feeling helpless and hopeless, but no psychotic symptoms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, the patient was monitored for signs of
withdrawal, educated about methadone and Suboxone, and reevaluated for
psychopharmacology.  She complained of withdrawal syndromes, no mydriasis
or piloerection were noted, she was treated with clonidine uneventfully.  I
saw her on January 30, 2012, and did not believe that she had bipolar
disorder and she was not in opiate withdrawal at that time.  She declined
HIV and hepatitis C testing, was calm on Haldol 10 mg at bedtime, accepted
Prozac 20 mg at bedtime (for complaints about anxiety, prescribed
previously by other physicians).  On the day of discharge she was started
on Zyprexa 25 at bedtime for impulse control and insomnia.

Side effects including weight gain, possible akathisia and dystonia were
discussed, and she was educated that she would likely experience some dry
mouth and might experience constipation.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  As above.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Prozac 20 mg at bedtime; Zyprexa 25 at bedtime.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient will go to the Lynn Community Health Center,
brother's girlfriend has allowed her to use their address for her Mass
Health application and she will apply.

She understands that she may use the Lynn Community Health Center
(781-581-3900) at 269 Union Street in Lynn for medical, dental,  and mental
health services.

She can contact mother or brother if in crisis, call #911 if she is in a
dangerous situation, and work with Lynn Community Health to complete the
application for Mass Health and to initiate primary care.

ADDENDUM:  Case manager, Paul Lozo, called the father (Frank, 352-293-3517)
who is aware that the patient is being discharged, did not believe the
patient was using any drugs other than marijuana (the patient did not show
signs of withdrawal during this admission), though case manager reviewed
patient's urine drug screen on the phone.  He cannot help her get back to
Florida, agrees that the patient is only looking for a place to stay, and
is likely to continue using drugs, though "if she can make her way down
here, she can stay here."  the case manager also called brother (Frank) and
left him a message.

It should be noted that the patient's reported to case manager that she
gave the patient money last week and the patient spent the money on drugs.
Mother believes the patient should be back in Florida because of the lack
of negative influences and she has used drugs less frequently and less
heavily in Florida than she does in Massachusetts.

Assessment:

This is a 31 y.o. y/o female with a history of MDD with psychotic features, multiple prior suicide attempts, and

PTSD who presents with CAH to harm herself in the context of peri-partum worsening depression.

These symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of MDD with psychotic features, or bipolar disorder

given the peri-partum presentation.

The patient requires inpatient admission for safety, containment, medication adjustment, intensification of

aftercare, and inpatient ECT.

The primary target symptoms and goals of this admission are to address her CAH and worsening depression

via medication plan and potentially inpatient ECT.

Axis I: MDD with psychotic features vs BPAD

Axis II: deferred

Axis III: pregnancy, DM, pilocytic astrocytoma s/p partial resection and XRT, peripheral neuropathy

Axis IV: history of sexual trauma, emotional trauma, lack of supportive relationship from baby's father

Consent for Treatment with Psychiatric Medications:
Discharge Summaries by Stuart E Beck, MD at 9/29/2016            3:50 PM (continued)

No new psychiatric medications have been introduced and/or started since the last patient consent was

received and documented.

The patient was informed of alternative treatments, the consequences of no treatment, and the expected

duration of treatment. The patient appeared to appreciate the information conveyed in the consent process by

asking appropriate questions and expressing understanding of these potential risks and benefits.

Hospital Course

The patient was admitted to the locked inpatient, psychiatric unit on Blake 11 at MGH for further evaluation and

treatment of depression with psychotic features.    The patient was admitted under section 10 legal status.

The attending physician of record was Dr. Stuart Beck.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:                The patient presented with the following issues on admission.

1.  Primary psychiatric problem. The patient?s depression with psychotic features was addressed in a

multimodal fashion.   Specifically, medication treatment included a cross-taper from Seroquel (downtitrated to

50mg qHS) to Abilify (uptitrated to 10mg qAM) and initiaion of nortriptyline (uptitrated to 25mg qHS), and

psychotherapeutic interventions included small groups from psychology and occupational therapy were

available, although the patient was not comfortable as she speaks Spanish and was unwilling to use an

interpreter. These medication changes were made with consultation from the women's mental health

department at MGH.    She did meet with her family and socialized with Spanish-speaking peers.        She was

offered ECT but refused treatment. She ultimately left against medical advice. The team felt she would benefit

from continued hospitalization for further medication titration and improvement of depressive symptoms,

however she has close follow up on Monday with her outpatient provider, Meredith Waites, and was not felt to

be at risk of harming herself nor others.

2.  Medical issues. The patient was seen by a physician from Maternal Fetal Medicine for consultation on the

use of psychotropic medications and for evaluation of suspected gestational diabetes.  Their recommendations

were implemented and made part of the patient's treatment plan.  The patient's fetal ultrasound was normal.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT

The patient was at elevated risk for self-harm on admission due to active symptoms of depression and recent

symptoms of psychosis with voices telling her to self harm. However, since admission, the patient has has had

improvement of depressive symptoms with improved mood and sleep. The patient engaged in treatment

(individual work) on the unit, and has taken and tolerated medications without problem.        Finally, over the

course of the hospitalization, the patient became more hopeful, more engaged, and more future-oriented, as

evidenced by her discussions of planning for her infant..

The patient is at chronically elevated risk for harm to self or others compared with general population due to

psychiatric illness, including depression and psychosis with prior suicide attempts. However, pt is protected by

committed outpatient treaters, supportive family, and her positivity surrounding her pregnancy. Patient is

motivated to continue outpatient psychiatric treatment. Patient is able to articulate a plan to reach out for help

from providers and family if symptoms worsen and to go to an emergency room or call 911 if feeling unsafe.

Therefore, the patient is not at acutely elevated risk of harm at this time and is appropriate for outpatient level

of care.

DISCHARGE PLAN

Medication prescriptions were given to patient as per the discharge form.

All questions were answered, and discharge instructions were given in writing to the patient.

Emergency contact information was given to the patient if needed in the future.

Outpatient providers have been notified about the discharge.

Patient discharged in stable condition to home with her mother.

AFTERCARE PLAN

Treatment of Depression with Psychosis

1. Please continue Abilify 10mg qAM and uptitrate to therapeutic level. Please downtitrate Seroquel 50mg QHS

over the next two weeks. Please uptitrate nortriptyline 25mg qHS to a therapeutic level. Please continue Abilify

and nortriptyline at therapeutic level after delivery. Both are very low risk with breast feeding and important to

continue to prevent post partum depression and psychosis.

2. Please check EKG for prolonged QTc in the setting of these QTc prolonging medications. Patient left AMA,

last EKG ws 9/29 with normal QTc.

3. Consider group programs for Spanish speaking women for more social stimulation and support.

Impression:  26 y.o. female with with history of depressive disorder, PTSD with previous suicide attempt who

was brought in by EMS after having SI with intent and plan to stab her self in the stomach with a knife and

psychiatry consulted for safety evaluation.    Patient endorses multiple neurovegetative symptoms depression in

the context of chronic psychosocial stressors and unclear recent trigger that led to SI with intent and plan to

stab her self with a knife.  This also led to worsening of her PTSD symptoms including AH of previous man who

sexually assaulted her.      On exam she appears dysphoric and does not appear manic, psychotic, intoxicated,

delirious.  Presentation consistent with MDD, likely not psychotic features getting fleeting nature and likely

PTSD with borderline traits.     Given lack of outpatient treaters, lack of supports, SI with intent and plan, previous

suicide attempt, she is high risk for self-harm and meets criteria for inpatient level care for safety, stabilization,

medication initiation and aftercare planning.  Will admit to 3 E. now that she is medically cleared and Covid

negative, no home medications to continue

Psychiatry Attending

HOSPITAL COURSE:          My first encounter with the patient was on 07/28/21. The patient's safety, ADLs, vital

signs, compliance with medications, groups attendence were discussed with staff and treatment team. Medical

record was reviewed. Potential side effect, risks and benefits of medications were discussed. The pt was

cooperative with the interview. She reported feeling unsafe at home, cut herself superficially, "heard voices of

men" whom she was in relationship, and call 911. The pt has had multiple prior hospitalizations. She has no

outpatient providers, and has not been engaged in any treatment. She sad that in the past was taking Zyprexa

and Haldol, but had side effects, and describe, most probably, dystonic reaction. She denied treatment with

antidepressants, or mood stabilizers. The pt reported h/o PTSD from "beeing rape many times". She did not

endorsed symptoms of PTSD. She denied neurovegetative symptoms ether. The pt denied SA, mania, frank

psychosis, aggression towards others.

She lives alone in studio apartment, which is paid for by her father. On the other hand, the pt stated that her

parents are "not supportive". She does not work, and gets "food money from government". The pt does not

have any meaningful daiy structure. She has not been working, stating that "all the time men at work are

stalking [her].

The pt reported h/o OD at age 15, "which did not workout, and did nog go to the hospital".

No acute medical issues.

Since admission, the pt has been in good control, denied feeling suicidal. She signed CV.

The pt is willing to try low dose of Abilify. She stated that feels safe in the hospital, and wants to discuss

discharge plan.

The patient continued to endorse auditory hallucination, presenting with affect and bizarre behavior, feeling

paranoid towards male staff.   Initially, the patient declined Abilify, or any antipsychotic medications, due to

concern of potential side effects.  The patient has been denying suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, any

urges to harm herself or others.    She has been sleeping well.      She attended some groups with minimal

participation.   At times staff observed the patient self dialoguing and laughing inappropriately.  Her boundaries

with male patients were limited.,   And open she required staff redirection. Twice,   the patient flooded the toilet.

On the other hand, the patient has been in good control.   Her sleep, appetite and hygiene have been good.

Vital signs have been stable and within normal limits.    Laboratory data were unremarkable.

On 07/02/21 I met with the patient and her parents together with Sara Podsen, LICSW. The pt's symptoms,

safety concerns, potential diagnoses of personality disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic discoursed were

discussed. The pt's noncompliance with medications were address. The parents stated that when the pt takes

medications, she is definitely functioning much better. Unfortunately, after discharge from the hospital, she

Discharge Summary by Valentina Jalynytchev, MD at 7/13/2021                      8:42 AM (continued)

Since the initiation of treatment with Abilify 2 mg, the patient started to report decrease of auditory

hallucinations, and "thinking became much more clear".       She agreed to increase Abilify to 5 mg/day.    The

patient denied any side effects.    As hospitalization progressed, it became more apparent, that some symptoms

stem from patient's character pathology with cluster B features, rather than depression / mania/ frank

psychosis.      At the end of the hospitalization, the patient denied paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, and

requested discharge.

The patient case has been discussed with the treatment team regularly.           We all agreed, that the patient has

made good clinical progress, that she is stable and safe to leave the hospital and continue her care as

outpatient.     The patient is hopeful and future oriented.  She has no access to firearms.     She presents no

imminent likelihood of self-harm or others.   The patient is capable to make a treatment decision, and is not

committable.    The patient's parents agreed with discharge and aftercare plan.

The prescriptions were electronically transmitted to CVS on Main Street in Waltham, 1 month supply with no

refills.

Safety Assessment:

Karina Mendez no longer requires a secure, structured, inpatient, psychiatric setting in order to prevent

harm and to assure safety. The patient can be safely released to the community. Protective factors include:

no SI/ HI, mood is euthymic; pt has been compliant with medications while in the hospital; no evidence of

psychosis, pt is hopeful and future-oriented; supportive family; aftercare is in place. Risk factors include;

chronic mental illness, limited coping skills; h/o treatment noncompliance; multiple hospitalizations; h/o one

OD on Tylenol and alcohol in 2018. Prognosis for recovery from current episode is good, if pt stays sober

and compliant with outpatient treatment. Therefore, we feel the risk of imminent harm to self or others is

minimal. The patient has decision making capacity and patient and family agrees with discharge and

aftercare plans.

Communication of the Psychiatric Transition Record:

The patient's transition record has been communicated to the next level of care provider(s).

The psychiatric transition record includes the discharge medications, after care recommendations, principle

diagnoses, and reason for hospitalization.
